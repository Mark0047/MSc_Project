        "notes": "Electron backscatter diffraction was used to quantify grain boundary misorientations in experimental samples doped with deuterium-enriched water. The same samples were subsequently studied with nanoSIMS to look for boundary enrichment of D2O. Grain boundary misorientation data were collected using EBSD to test the possibility of misorientation angle dependence on measured D2O concentrations. No clear misorientation dependence was observed. Folders names include the name of the PDRA who collected the data. Data are images, text files (ctf), and other file formats that can be opened using Oxford Instruments EBSD software. Supporting EDS files are available on request",
