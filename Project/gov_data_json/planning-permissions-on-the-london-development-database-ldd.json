The LDD recorded any planning consent that permits one or more of the following:\n\n*   any new build residential units\n*   any loss or gain of residential units through change of use or conversion of existing dwellings\n*   creation of seven or more new bedrooms for use as either a hotel, a hostel, student housing or for residential care through new build or change of use\n*   1,000m2 or more of floor space changing from one use class to another or created through new build or extension for any other use\n*   the loss or gain or change of use of open space.\n\nThe spreadsheet _LDD - Planning permissions_ includes details of all permissions either currently recorded as live (not started or under construction), completed since 01/04/2006 or permitted since 01/04/2006 and subsequently superseded or lapsed. _LDD - Non-residential floorspace_ provides additional details of the non-residential floor space for those permissions with a non-residential component and _LDD - non-residential bedrooms_ provides additional details of the non-C3 bedrooms over the same time period.",
