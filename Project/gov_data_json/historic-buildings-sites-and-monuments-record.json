        "notes": "In order to be able to carry out its many functions, Cornwall Council has compiled an encyclopaedic archive of information on the historic environment of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. The archive includes information on all aspects of the past from the earliest traces of human occupation up to the present day.\n\nEssential to the identification, protection, conservation and interpretation of the historic environment is the maintenance and enhancement of an up to date archive of information on individual historic sites, monuments, buildings, artefacts and landscapes in the county. Cornwall and Scilly Historic Environment Record (HER) staff maintain the Cornwall and Scilly Historic Buildings, Sites and Monuments Record (HBSMR) database of almost 60,000 records. This is constantly being updated as new information is acquired.\n\n The HER plays a key role in providing the information base for recommendations made by the Planning Service and Countryside Advice Teams in response to planning applications and other proposals. The information provides a starting point for management processes, conservation (such as forming the basis for the selection of sites where improved management regimes or repair work would be beneficial), fieldwork and research into the historic environment and also informs local communities about their area. In turn, many of these activities generate new information which feeds back to the HER. The record is also routinely used by academics, researchers, students and others interested in the archaeology and heritage of the area.\n\nInformation in the HBSMR has been derived from a variety of sources including published and unpublished books and pamphlets, specialist journals, antiquarian authors, museum records, as well as reports of fieldwork, surveys and excavations and information sent in by landowners, farmers, and members of the public.\n\nThe record can be used in a variety of ways including:\n - Advancing knowledge and understanding of the historic environment; \n - Supporting management and conservation of sites and landscapes \n - Underpinning strategic policies for the protection of the historic environment \n - Supporting decision-making in local authority land-use planning systems; \n - Contributing to environmental improvement and economic regeneration schemes; \n - Contributing to education and social inclusion and;  \n - Encouraging the exploration, appreciation and enjoyment of the historic environment. \n\nAccuracy of Content:\nThe level of detail and the accuracy of the information held on each site reflects the nature or content of the sources used to compile the record. With almost 60,000 records in the dataset it has been possible to verify the information 'on the ground' in only a small percentage of sites. Users of this data should consult the HER to clarify the level of reliability and/or precision that should be afforded to information derived from the HBSMR.\n\nThe Site and its Content is provided for your general information only; we do not undertake that Content will always be accurate and complete. Therefore, if you propose to do, or refrain from doing, something in reliance upon Content you find on the Site, you must check the accuracy of the relevant Content by some other means.",
