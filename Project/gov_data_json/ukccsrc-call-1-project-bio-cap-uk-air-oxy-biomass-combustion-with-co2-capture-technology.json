In terms of assessing CO2 capture, the UK CCS on-going research portfolio includes coal and gas-fired generation, whilst limited work is being conducted on the assessment of dedicated biomass to power with CCS, or indeed, of co-firing fossil fuel generation with higher rates of biomass with CCS. The project will also greatly expand the on-going research in SuperGen Bioenergy concerning supply chains of torrefied biomass and Bio-CCS. Grant number: UKCCSRC-C1-38.",
