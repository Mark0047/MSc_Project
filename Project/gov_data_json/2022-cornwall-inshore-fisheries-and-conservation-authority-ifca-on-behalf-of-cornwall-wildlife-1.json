The survey site is within the Falmouth Bay to St Austell Bay Special Protection Area (SPA). This project was funded as part of the G7 Legacy Fund. The contract includes joint intellectual property (IP) of all data collected. \n     The aim of the survey was to map the extent and coverage of the seagrass bed within Gerrans Bay using a Biosonics MX Scientific Echosounder. In total 170 acoustic survey lines were completed, all of which were included in the analysis.",
