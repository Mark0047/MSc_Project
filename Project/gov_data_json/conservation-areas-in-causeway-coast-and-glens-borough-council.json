The\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nia/2011/25/contents/enacted\">Planning Act (NI) 2011\u00a0</a>(Section 104) provides the Council with the power to designate an area of special architectural or historic interest as a Conservation Area. Within the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council Area there are 5 Conservation Areas with Individual townscape and design advice contained in the relevant designation booklets.\u00a0 These Conservation Area guides should be used as the first point of reference when bringing forward development proposals in these areas and will be used by the Council in assessing applications, along with\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.planningni.gov.uk/index/policy/planning_statements_and_supplementary_planning_guidance.htm\">Planning Policy Statement 6: Planning,\u00a0Archaeology and the Built Heritage</a>.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Below is a list of existing CAs and the associated design guides along with dates that each Conservation Area was designated by the Department of the Environment;</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.planningni.gov.uk/index/policy/supplementary_guidance/conservation/conservation_map/conservation_cushendall.htm\">Cushendall Conservation Area</a>\u00a0\u2013 Designated as a CA in 1975,\u00a0being only the second such area in Northern Ireland.\u00a0 The CA includes the historic core of the village on the west bank of River Dall, together with the extensive wooded grounds of The Cottage and Court McMartin, and the older parts of the settlement on Kilnadore Road and Coast Road.\u00a0\u00a0The current Cushendall Conservation Area Design Guide was published in November 1993.</li></ul><p>\u00a0</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.planningni.gov.uk/index/policy/supplementary_guidance/conservation/conservation_map/conservation_cushendun.htm\">Cushendun Conservation Area</a>\u00a0\u2013 The village and surrounding lands were designated as a CA in 1980 due to its unique architectural inheritance, partly influenced\u00a0by Clough Williams Ellis a leading architect of his time, and its picturesque setting. \u00a0The Cushendun Conservation Area Design Guide was published in December 1996.</li></ul><p>\u00a0</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.planningni.gov.uk/index/policy/supplementary_guidance/conservation/conservation_map/conservation_ballycastle.htm\">Ballycastle Conservation Area</a>\u00a0\u2013 Designated as a CA in 1990, the area includes the historic upper town around The Diamond and part of the Lower Town and the connecting tree and villa lined mall of Quay Road. The Ballycastle Conservation Area Design Guide was published in June 1990.</li></ul><p>\u00a0</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.planningni.gov.uk/index/policy/supplementary_guidance/conservation/conservation_map/conservation_bushmills.htm\">Bushmills Conservation Area</a>\u00a0\u2013 Designated as a CA in 1992, the central\u00a0Market Square\u00a0of the village includes a large grouping of Listed Buildings within the CA along with other heritage features and older parts of the world famous Bushmills Distillery and remains of mill races. The Bushmills Conservation Area Design Guide was published in June 1992.</li></ul><p>\u00a0</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.planningni.gov.uk/index/policy/supplementary_guidance/conservation/conservation_map/conservation_ballymoney.htm\">Ballymoney Conservation Area</a>\u00a0\u2013 The historic core of Ballymoney was designated as a CA in 1994, radiating out from The Diamond to include Charlotte Street, High Street, Church Street, Victoria Street and Main Street.</li></ul><p>\u00a0</p><p>The designation of Conservation Areas and the production of the associated design guides have contributed to the overall enhancement of the areas and\u00a0resulted in the sympathetic restoration and physical regeneration of many buildings, some of which had lost part of their original character.\u00a0 The designations and associated guides continue to play an important role in influencing and shaping\u00a0the built form in these historic areas.\u00a0 The aesthetic reasons for retaining the best of the built inheritance has helped\u00a0raise public awareness of conservation.\u00a0 Many environmental and economic benefits can also be derived from Conservation Area designations, such as tourism and heritage related leisure activities making them desirable places to live, work, shop and do business.</p></div>",
