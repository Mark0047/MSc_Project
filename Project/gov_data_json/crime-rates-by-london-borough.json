All data relates to \"notifiable offences\" - which are designated categories of crimes that all police forces in England and Wales are required to report to the Home Office<br /> Crime rates are not available for Heathrow due to no population figures</p>\r\n<p>Monthly crime data by borough and ward is available from the Met Police website, available around one month after month end.</p>\r\n<p>The total number of recorded crimes per month is also shown. A fuller breakdown by 32 different types of crime is available on the MPS website.</p>\r\n<p>There were changes to the police recorded crime classifications from April 2012. Therefore caution should be used when comparing sub-groups of crime figures from 2012/13 with earlier years.</p>\r\n<p>Action Fraud have taken over the recording of fraud offences on behalf of individual police forces. This process began in April 2011 and was rolled out to all police forces by March 2013. Due to this change caution should be applied when comparing data over this transitional period and with earlier years.</p>\r\n<p>Link to data on <a href=\"http://maps.met.police.uk/tables.htm\">Met Police website.</a></p>\r\n<p>Crime stats on <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/crime-stats/crime-statistics/index.html\">ONS website</a></p>\r\n</div>",
