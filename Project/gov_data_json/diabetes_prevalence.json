It is a measure of recorded diabetes prevalence and not actual prevalence and therefore under-reports groups who are less likely to be registered with a GP, such as ethnic populations, young people, homeless people, migrants and travellers. Record level data is not available therefore we have to apportion practices to LAs based on a look up file created from NSTS data. The NSTS practice file does not completely match the QOF practices and therefore the apportioning may not mirror exactly where the patients come from, but it is the best approximation with the data provided. The diabetes prevalence will not match up with the QOF published prevalence where the areas are identical due to a different denominator being used (QOF uses the practice list size whereas the Health Profiles use the resident population).",
