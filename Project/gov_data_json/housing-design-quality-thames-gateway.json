        "notes": "An assessment of the design quality of 41 planned housing schemes in the Thames Gateway. The assessment was carried out during 2007/2008 and was based on the Building for Life criteria. The criteria were applied to residential planning applications for major housing or mixed use schemes delivering significant additional homes to the area, and with a minimum of 50 dwellings in each scheme. Data includes local authority, scheme name, number of units, planning application date, planning approval date, scores for all twenty Building for Life criteria, and total scheme scores. There is also incomplete data on whether the scheme had a development brief, design standards, a master plan, a design & access statement, was built on private or public land, designated or otherwise, whether the local authority had design policies in place and the existence of design skills in the local authority.\r\n",
