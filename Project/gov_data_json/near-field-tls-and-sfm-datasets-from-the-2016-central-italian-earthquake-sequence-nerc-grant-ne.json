        "notes": "Terrestrial laser scanning datasets (including GPS data for georeferencing), structure from motion datasets, and field photographs collected during the 2016 Central Italian Earthquake sequence. Data were collected from multiple localities to capture the co- and post- seismic near-fault deformation along the earthquake surface ruptures. See the scan_data.xlsx for individual details of each laser scan location, and readme.txt for a complete description. In each scan site folder you can find the unprocessed raw files and processed ascii files. Note, not all processed files are georeferenced.This is due to time constraints on field data collection. Georeferencing for these data can be achieved by point cloud matching to other georeferenced scans. Photos for structure from motion (SfM) datasets were collected with a Nikon camera. All original photos are provided. Field photographs taken in the aftermath of the 2016 Norcia Earthquake (30th October 2016, Mw6.6) are also provided.
