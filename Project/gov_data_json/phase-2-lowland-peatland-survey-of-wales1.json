        "notes": "\n      This dataset is part of the Phase 2 Habitats surveys conducted across Wales. It consists of a detailed survey of plant communities in lowland peatland vegetation.  The survey work was split into two time periods, with the first Phase 2 lowland peatland surveys being conducted between 1977 and 1982. There was then a break between this and the second tranche of surveys which have occurred from 2004 onwards. These more modern surveys were conducted on sites already covered on the 1997-1982 surveys and on newer identified sites. The surveys were conducted at Phase 2 (plant community) level of herbaceous mire habitats predominantly within the lowland environment of Wales. Key project outputs include site-based assessments of community type, distribution and ecology and evaluative accounts\n of vegetation and its condition. Strategic outputs include Area of Search/regional/all Wales synthesis and analysis of data to inform site selection, conservation and restoration. This part of the Phase 2 survey just includes species datasets collected by Countryside Council for Wales and Natural Resources Wales in-house expert Phase 2 survey team.  Peer-based quality assurance is carried out within the team and by CCW's Peatland Specialist. Regular meetings are held to ensure consistent community and species determination and survey protocol application.\n\nThe primary objective of the survey is to characterise and evaluate the vegetation cover of lowland peatlands in Wales to ensure the identification, protection and management of important peatland sites.  All Wales coverage although sites vary in size and complexity. The survey programme is almost wholly confined to lowland mires, i.e. those below the upper functional limit of agricultural enclosure. A few mires above this limit may be considered where they display essentially lowland characteristics or where survey would provide additional critical information for rare communities. The survey encompasses all lowland Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) supporting at least one independently qualifying peatland feature. The only exceptions to this are (i) the largest of the raised mi\nres (namely Cors Fochno, Cors Caron, and Fenns, Whixall, Bettisfield, Wem and Cadney Mosses), and (ii) any sites for which recent reliable information collected in a manner broadly comparable to that of the current survey is already available. Non-statutory sites are included if they have peatland features considered likely to be of individually qualifying status or if they have a notable mire element. A 0.5 ha threshold for individual or groups of communities has been used to help prioritise sites for survey.\n\n    ",
