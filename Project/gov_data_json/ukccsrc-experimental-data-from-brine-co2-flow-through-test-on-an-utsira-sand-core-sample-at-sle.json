        "notes": "The spreadsheet gathers the data collected during an experiment conducted on a Utsira Sand formation core sample to complements and constrains existing geophysical monitoring surveys at Sleipner and, more generally, improves the understanding of shallow weakly-cemented sand reservoirs. The tests were conducted in the rock physics laboratory at the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, during 2016, as part of the DiSECCS project with funding from the United Kingdom\u2019s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC grant EP/K035878/1) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). The experiment was a steady state brine-CO2 flow-through test to simultaneously evaluate ultrasonic waves, electrical resistivity (converted into pore fluid distribution) and mechanical indicators during CO2 geosequestration in shallow weakly-cemented reservoirs. The confining and pore pressure conditions were similar to those estimated for Sleipner (North Sea \u2013 like storage reservoirs), but simulating inflation/depletion cyclic scenarios for increasing brine:CO2 fractional flow rates. The data include primary ultrasonic wave velocities and attenuation factors, axial and radial strains, and electrical resistivity. Also, we provide a velocity-saturation relationship of practical importance to CO2 plume monitoring, obtained from the inversion of ultrasonic velocity and attenuation data and extrapolation of results to field-scale seismic-frequencies using a new rock physics theory. The dataset is linked to this publication: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750583617306370.",
