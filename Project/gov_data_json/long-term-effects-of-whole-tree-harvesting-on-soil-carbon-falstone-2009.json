        "notes": "Kielder (Flastone 7) is the the oldest  whole tree harvesting experiments in Europe. The site is currently a 34-year-old second rotation stand of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), in Kielder forest, UK. The stand treatments include Whole Tree Harvesting (WTH\u2014of all above ground biomass), Conventional stem-only harvesting (CH) of the first rotation crop, OB - brash left on site (e.g. conventional harvesting), OO - brash removed from site (e.g. whole tree harvesting),,HB (fertilisation treatments) and repeated Fertilisation (FE) after the planting of the second rotation forest. SEM, mentioned in the data set is the standard error on the mean.\nNutrient leaching from the litter layer after clear-felling of the first rotation Sitka spruce stands have been evaluated in the past (Malcolm and Titus 1983). The nutrient changes in the peaty gley soils after the clear-felling of the Sitka spruce stands were also assessed (Titus and Malcolm 1991). Growth reductions in Sitka spruce after 10 years following whole tree harvesting at these sites were reported by Proe and Dutch (1994) and tree nutrient status through foliar analysis was reported by Proe et al. (1996, 1999). Aboveground tree parameters such as height and diameter have been recorded every three years. Soil and roots survey were carried out in 2009. Long term effects of whole tree harvesting on soil carbon and nutrient sustainability have been evaluated in 2010 (Vanguelova et al., 2010). Long term impacts of WTH and fertilisation. Full above and below-ground carbon and nutrient balance and allocation are under evaluation (Vanguelova et al. in prep.). The soil survey will be repeated at the end of the rotation before clear fell.\nVangeulova et al (2010) Long term effects of whole tree harvesting on soil carbon\nand nutrient sustainability in the UK.
