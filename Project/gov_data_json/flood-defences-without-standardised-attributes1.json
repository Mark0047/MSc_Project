The defences shown provide different levels of flood protection and this is recognised in the risk classification shown in the Flood Risk Assessment Wales (FRAW) map. Flood defences that are not yet shown, and the areas that benefit from them, will be gradually added.\r\nFlood defences do not remove the risk of flooding however and can be overtopped or fail in extreme weather conditions.\r\n    ",
