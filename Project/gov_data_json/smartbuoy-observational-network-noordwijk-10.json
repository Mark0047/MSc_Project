        "notes": "On the SmartBuoy, surface measurements of plant nutrient concentrations are \nderived from two instruments. The NAS-3X in-situ nutrient analyser takes \nhourly measurements of nitrate concentration, while lower frequency (daily) \nmeasurements of nitrate and silicate concentration are derived from laboratory \nanalysis of water samples collected and preserved by the WMS-2 water sampler. \nAn estimate of phytoplankton concentration (biomass) is obtained twice per \nhour using a fluorometer measuring chlorophyll fluorescence. To aid \ninterpretation of these data, SmartBuoy also takes measurements of \nconductivity, temperature, suspended sediment concentration, light penetration \nwith the ESM2 logger. Data are telemetered every two hours using ORBCOMM \nsatellite telemetry.\n\nThe Noordwijk 10 SmartBuoy is located at 52.301 N, 4.303 E. It started logging \nin September 2001 and finished in September 2001.",
