        "notes": "Coordinated by Haroun Mahgerefteh at UCL, the EC funded FP7 CO2QUEST project addressed the main challenges associated with determining the optimal composition and purity of CO2 product streams derived from carbon capture systems for enabling its safe and economic transport and storage. The project brought together academics and major stakeholders to perform computational studies backed-up by large-scale experiments aimed at identifying CO2 mixtures that have the most profound impact on the different parts of the CCS chain. The project ran from March 2013 until June 2016, involving 9 partners across Europe, including from Canada and China. It resulted in over 100 peer reviewed journal publications and conference proceedings, three international conferences and several newsletters, receiving the IChemE Highly Commended Global Process Safety Award in 2016. More information about CO2QUEST including its objectives, deliverables and list of publications may be found at: http://www.co2quest.eu/",
