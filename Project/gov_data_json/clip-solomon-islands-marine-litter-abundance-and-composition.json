The file Solomon_Marine_Litter_Data.csv \ncontains data on litter found on marine beaches in Solomon Islands between \nNovember 2018 and January 2019. The number of itemsis reported for each \nlitter category. The list of litter categories was obtain merging OSPAR and \nTangaroa Blue protocols with the addition of region-specific items, which are \nmarked with '*'. An array of metadata (location names, survey date, GPS \ncoordinates in decimal degrees) is also reported per each data point. \n\nThe file Solomon_Marine_Litter_Metadata.csv reports other metadata \ncollected during the surveys following the OSPAR protocol to describe \nfactors potentially influencing litter characteristics. A READ-ME text file \ncontains a legend of the columns of the csv files. \n\n\n\nThis dataset contains 3 csv files. One file contains data on marine litter \nabundance and composition expressed in number of items per category. One file \ncontains location names and GPS coordinates in decimal degrees. One file \ncontains metadata collected during the clean-ups. A READ-ME text file contains \ndescription of columns content for the three csv files. Marine litter items \nwere collected during beach clean-ups on Guadalcanal Island (Solomon Islands) \nbetween November 2018 and January 2019.
