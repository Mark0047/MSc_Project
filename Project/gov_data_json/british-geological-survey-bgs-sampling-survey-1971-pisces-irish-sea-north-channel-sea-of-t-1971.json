        "notes": "This manned submersible sampling survey undertaken by the British Geological Survey took place in May 1971 in the Irish Sea, North Channel, Sea of The Hebrides and North Minch areas aboard the vessel Vickers Venturer. The purpose was to evaluate the institutes shallow seismic records which show the possibility of low-lying outcrops of bedded strata amongst drift . The manned submersible operated by a pilot and geologist observer was fitted with two stereo cameras, rockdrill and manipulator arm. Thirteen dives were undertaken to obtain geological samples. These data are archived by BGS. The geological results and investigation techniques are contained in BGS (IGS) report 73/2.",
