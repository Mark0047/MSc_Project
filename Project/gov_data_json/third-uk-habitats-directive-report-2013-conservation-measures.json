        "notes": "This dataset lists conservation measures for habitats and species listed under the Habitats Directive. Every six years, all EU Member States are required (under Article 17 of the Directive) to report on the implementation of the EU Habitats Directive. The 3rd UK Habitats Directive Report was submitted to the European Commission in 2013.\nThis report includes the need to report on Conservation measures in section 3.2 of the reporting form. \nFor each habitat and species, a UK list of conservation measures was identified based on information provided by the Country Agencies (as detailed in the country-level reporting information). The measures identified represented activities undertaken primarily during the reporting period 2007-2012. They were selected from a standard list of codes/categories that was provided via the EC\nReporting Guidelines (see Appendix 4).\nEach measure was assigned to one or more of the following types:\n* legal/statutory;\n* administrative;\n* contractual;\n* recurrent;\n* one-off.\n\nThey were ranked as High, Medium or Low importance, based on the proportion of the target habitat benefiting from the measure.\nThe geographic area (location) that each measure primarily impacted on was classed as either:\n* inside the SAC network;\n* outside the SAC network;\n* both inside and outside the SAC network.\nFinally, a broad evaluation was given to indicate the effectiveness of each measure in maintaining, enhancing or reaching favourable conservation status (FCS). This was based on the following categories:\n* maintain \u00e2\u0080\u0093 used for measures that were required to maintain FCS;\n* enhance \u00e2\u0080\u0093 used for measures that enhanced conservation status:\n* long-term \u00e2\u0080\u0093 used for measures where a positive effect was expected only in the long-term;\n* no effect \u00e2\u0080\u0093 used for ineffective measures or measures that need to be improved, had not\ndelivered conservation benefits, had failed to achieve their objectives, or had adverse effects;\n* unknown effect \u00e2\u0080\u0093 used for measures whose effect was unknown;\n* not evaluated \u00e2\u0080\u0093 used for measures that not been evaluated.\nThe aggregation of the lists of conservation measures provided for each country followed that used for the lists of pressures",
