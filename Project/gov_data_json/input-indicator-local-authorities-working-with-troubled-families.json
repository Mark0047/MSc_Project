        "notes": "This indicator reports the percentage of local authorities who have begun to identify and work with troubled families in their area as part of DCLG's programme.\n\n#### How the figure is calculated:\r\n\r\nThe figure is the number of all troubled families that have been identified by upper tier local authorities to date given as a percentage of all families that authorities pledged to turn around (as indicated in the published data - see link below).  \r\n\r\n#### Why is this indicator in the business plan?\r\n\r\nThe indicator is a measure of the progress being made by local authorities at this early stage of the Troubled Families Programme. Identifying the real names and addresses and all the various family members of families that are right for this programme is not always easy as we have targeted families for the first time whose range of problems will often cut across education, crime, worklessness and other issues. This involves lots of different local agencies sharing information and making an assessment about whether families they're individually working with are the right ones for this programme. \r\n\r\n#### How often is it updated?\r\n\r\nData is updated quarterly.\r\n\r\n####Where does the data come from?\r\n\r\nSelf-declarations by local authorities, which are provided to the DCLG Troubled Families Team.\r\n\r\n#### What area does the headline figure cover?\r\n\r\nEngland\r\n\r\n#### Are further breakdowns of the data available?\r\n\r\nBy local authority. For data at local authority level see: [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/troubled-families-programme-progress-information-at-december-2014-and-families-turned-around-at-february-2015](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/troubled-families-programme-progress-information-at-december-2014-and-families-turned-around-at-february-2015)\r\n\r\n#### What does a change in this indicator show?\r\n\r\nThese figures show the extent of progress in local authorities working towards their commitments for the programme. They show that councils are on course to meet the Prime Minister's target. The number of families that the Prime Minister pledged to turn around have now been identified. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Time Lag\r\n\r\n2 months\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Next available update\r\n\r\nTo be confirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Type of Data\r\n\r\nManagement Information\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Robustness and data limitations\r\n\r\nThere are 117,910 families targeted under the government\u2019s Troubled Families programme. For rounding purposes, however, the target is usually referred to as 120,000.\r\n\r\n#### Links to Further Information\r\n\r\n[https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/helping-troubled-families-turn-their-lives-around](https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/helping-troubled-families-turn-their-lives-around)\r\n\r\n#### Contact Details\r\n\r\n[CorporatePerformance@communities.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:CorporatePerformance@communities.gsi.gov.uk)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
