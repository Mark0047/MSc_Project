        "notes": "[This dataset is embargoed until September 1, 2023]. This dataset contains information about the multivariate plastic life-history responses and thermal tolerance capability of 56 Daphnia magna clones exposed to 4 different environments. The experiment was conducted in a laboratory at the University of Liverpool in 2017. The work was part of a larger mesocosm study that aimed to tease apart how plasticity and genetic diversity influence the evolutionary potential of natural populations.\nLife history data were measured in common garden experiments. For each clone of the same genotype across all environments, we measured length at maturity, length at second clutch, age at maturity, age at second clutch, juvenile growth rate ((length at maturity - length as neonate)/ age at maturity), adult growth rate ((length at second clutch - length at maturity)/(age at second clutch-age at maturity)), average fecundity (across clutches 1 and 2), and average offspring size (across clutches 1 and 2.\nThe work was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council (Grant NE/K007394/1).\nFull details about this dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5285/cce747ad-7536-4669-a244-d8bc48693cc7",
