        "notes": "This dataset holds daily data from one automated weather station (AWS) located at the Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest, North East Wales. The data are on relative humidity (percent), air temperature (degrees Celsius), rainfall (millimetres), air pressure (millibars), net radiation (millivolts), solar radiation (kilowatts per square metre per second), photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), (micromol per square metre per second), wind speed (metres per second) and wind direction (degrees). Data is an extension of the daily AWS datasets for 1999-2015 and 2015-2016, for the time period September 2016 to December 2021. Data were recorded in minute intervals, averaged to half-hourly, then to daily means which are reported here. Data which were not recorded are marked with \u201cNA\u201d, faulty data were replaced with \u201c-9999\u201d. Data collection, processing and quality checking was carried out by members of CEH and UKCEH staff. The following measures were taken with sensors from Campbell Scientific: Rainfall sums are measured with an ARG100 Tipping bucket, air pressure is measured with a CS100 Barometer. Further, Solar radiation and PAR are measured using a Skye SP1110 pyranometer and a SKP215 quantum sensor from Skye Instruments. Wind direction and speed were recorded using a windsonic 2D Ultrasonic Anemometer from Windsonic. The Climoor field experiment intends to answer questions regarding the effects of warming and drought on ecosystem processes. The reported data are collected to monitor site specific environmental conditions and their development over time. These data are important to interpret results that are collected from the climate change manipulations imposed in the field.
