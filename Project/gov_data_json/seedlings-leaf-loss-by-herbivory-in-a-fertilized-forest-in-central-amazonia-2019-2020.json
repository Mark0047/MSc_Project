        "notes": "Data are presented showing for individual seedling, herbivory damage at the leaf level; galls, pathogens, trail herbivory presence/absence qualitative data; and leaf mortality. Data were collected in each leaf from a plot based fertilisation experiment. The experiment was carried out at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) approximately 100 km north of Manaus. Data were collected bimonthly from February 2019 to January 2020, by the dataset first author. Leaf loss in percentage was made using the choice for direct visual estimate. We also followed the recommendations proposed by the authors, sectoring the leaves with a millimetre grid, improving measurement accuracy. The presence of Galls, pathogens and trail herbivory presence/absence qualitative data were also collected in each leaf. The work was carried out as part of the Amazon Fertilization Experiment (AFEX), funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), Award reference NE/L007223/1, the Brazilian government (Researcher scholarship) and the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP - logistical support and camps maintenance).
