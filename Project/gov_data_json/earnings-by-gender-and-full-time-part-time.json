        "notes": "This dataset provides information about earnings of employees who are working in an area, who are on adult rates and whose pay for the survey pay-period was not affected by absence. Tables provided here include total hourly earnings (excluding overtime), with breakdowns by gender, and full-time/part-time status, with median, mean and earnings distribution for the London region. These are provided annually in nominal terms dating from 1997. The earnings information presented relates to pay before tax, National Insurance or other deductions. These National Statistics are produced to high professional standards and released according to the arrangements approved by the UK Statistics Authority. The Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) provides information about the levels, distribution and make-up of earnings and hours worked for employees in all industries and occupations. ASHE is based on a 1% sample of employee jobs taken from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) Pay As You Earn (PAYE) records. Information on earnings and hours is obtained from employers and treated confidentially. ASHE does not cover the self-employed nor does it cover employees not paid during the reference period. Further information is available on the ONS website.",
