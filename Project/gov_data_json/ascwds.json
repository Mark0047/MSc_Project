        "notes": "Skills for Care's Adult Social Care Workforce Data Set (ASC-WDS) is recognised as the leading source of high quality data and workforce intelligence for adult social care. The ASC-WDS collects information online about providers offering a social care service and their employees. Social care providers can register, maintain and access their business information at asc-wds.skillsforcare.org.uk.\r\n\r\nOur Workforce Intelligence team publish and share detailed information about the sector, add insight and interpretation via our written reports and create interactive visualisations to make the data more engaging. \r\n\r\nRepots and visualisations cover topics such as recruitment and retention, sickness, pay rates, qualifications and demographics. All information is based on estimates of the adult social care workforce, at national, regional and local level. Information can be found at www.skillsforcare.org.uk/workforceintelligence. \r\nBelow, information is available about our methodology, workforce estimates, published in Excel, and how to request raw ASC-WDS data files.\r\n\r\nSkills for Care publish information in such a range of formats to promote transparency in the collected data and also to further encourage use of the data by audiences such as government policymakers, academics, researchers, local authorities and workforce planners, as well as any other user with an interest in social care and labour markets. Our high-quality information about the workforce is vital in helping to effectively develop strategy, commission and plan for the workforce together, and this will, in turn, improve outcomes for the people who use these services, both now and in the future.",
