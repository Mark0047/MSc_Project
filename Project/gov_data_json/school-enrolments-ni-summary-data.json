Digital NI aims to help establish a culture within Northern Ireland that develops and enhances Digital capability not just through interactions with Government, but also with local companies and throughout communities. Within government the Digital Transformation Service is facilitating this cultural shift through a number of methods, transforming Government services, making data open and available and encouraging and coaching those who lack digital skills.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that opening up our data is the right thing to do in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the Public Sector in Northern Ireland. It has the potential to encourage new commercial opportunities and drive economic growth and innovation across public and private sectors.",

Nursery, grammar and special school Boards of Governors consist of representatives of the latter 3 categories.\r\nWithin the controlled sector there is a small but growing number of controlled integrated schools.\r\nVoluntary (maintained) schools are managed by Boards of Governors which consist of members nominated by trustees (mainly Roman Catholic), \r\nalong with representatives of parents, teachers and the Education Authority.\r\nVoluntary schools vary in the rates of capital grant to which they are entitled, depending on the management structures they have adopted. \r\nA majority are entitled to capital grants at 100%.\r\nVoluntary: (Non-Maintained) schools are mainly voluntary grammar schools, managed by Boards of Governors \r\nwhich consist of persons appointed as provided in each school's scheme of management along with representatives of parents and teachers and, in most cases, \r\nmembers appointed by the Department or the Education Authority. Voluntary Grammar Schools are funded directly by the Department.\r\nIn recent years a number of grant-maintained integrated schools have been established at primary level and post-primary levels. \r\nSuch schools are funded directly by the Department.\r\nThe practical operation of all schools has increasingly become a matter for Boards of Governors. They are responsible \r\nfor the delivery of the curriculum, admission of pupils, and in the case of schools with delegated budgets, for the management of their own financial affairs, \r\nincluding staffing matters. \r\nIndependent schools do not receive recurrent funding from the Dept Education.\r\n\r\nEnquiries relating to information collected in the school census in Northern Ireland\r\nshould be addressed to:\r\n\r\nAnalytical Services Unit\r\nDepartment of Education,\r\nRathgael House, \r\nBalloo Road, \r\nRathgill,\r\nBangor,\r\nCo.
