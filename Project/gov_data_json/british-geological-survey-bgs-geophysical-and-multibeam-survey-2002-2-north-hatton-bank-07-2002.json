        "notes": "This British Geological Survey (BGS) marine geophysical survey took place in July 2002 in the northern Rockall Trough and the northern end of Hatton Bank on board the RRS James Clark Ross (Cruise JR76). The purpose of the survey was 1) to in fill gaps in the existing seismic data coverage in order to address specific geological problems; 2) Identify windows in the Palaeogene lavas. Seafloor bathymetry data was collected using a Kongsberg-Simrad EM120 multibeam system. Subsurface seismic data were collected using an Airgun and Sparker, these data are archived by BGS and are available for download. Gravitational field, Magnetic field data were also collected. Most of the data were recorded digitally, and paper records were also generated. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS Internal Report IR/02/152 (http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/528019).
