        "notes": "Loch Sunart is a sealoch set in an area of outstanding landscape and scenic value and surrounded by several areas of particularly high nature conservation importance. It is also subject to increasing development by the marine fish farming industry with, already, many large salmon and shellfish farms present. The geographical position, size and hydrography of Loch Sunart, together with the limited previous observations on the marine life present, suggested that the marine habitats, communities and species might be of particular interest. For these reasons, the Marine Nature Conservation Review gave a high priority to a systematic sublittoral survey of Loch Sunart. As a precursor to a more detailed Phase 2 survey of the loch, the NCC supported the present volunteer team to carry out an extensive Phase 1 survey to provide initial information on types and distribution of the main habitats and communities and conspicuous species. In addition, this survey had the objectives of evaluating recording and survey methods for volunteer groups and enabling further assessment of the potential role of such groups in the MNCR. The 24 sites surveyed during the 2 day expedition gave a good geographic and ecological coverage of Loch Sunart. Constraints on time prevented survey coverage of Loch na Droma Buidhe and Loch Teachuis which might have increased the range of habitats and communities recorded. At the sites surveyed, the major habitats and communities and conspicuous species were described. Features found in the loch which are considered to be of particular scientific interest include: - extensive Limaria hians (Gaping File Shell) beds in the Laudale Narrows; - mud sediments off Carna with a diverse megafaunal burrowing community including several less frequently occuring species; - circalittoral cliff habitats at the entrance to Loch Sunart which support rich communities and many animal species of high interest; - extensive infralittoral and circalittoral bedrock with well developed communities present throughout the length of the loch. This is a preliminary list and it is anticipated that a subsequent Phase 2 survey would significantly extend it. Records currently considered sensitive have been removed from this dataset.",
