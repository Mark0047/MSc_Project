        "notes": "The aims of the cruise (cruise number 2013/4_ECORD) were to acquire high resolution geophysical data (multibeam echosounder, side scan sonar, surface tow boomer, magnetometer and CHIRP) and geotechnical data (CPT) in an area of the Chixculub impact crater. The cruise was carried out under contract for the British Geological Survey/ECORD Science Operator. The study area area is approximately 10.58 km2 located approximately 32 km northwest of Progreso, Mexico. An acquisition programme of geophysical survey lines were undertaken to cross three proposed IODP drill sites in order to map seabed morphology, shallow sub-surface geology and the presence of magnetic anomalies, and the context in which they were found. Details of the survey are contained in BGS Commissioned Report CR/13/049 (http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/519259/).",
