        "notes": "This data set gives annual figures for the number of house building starts per 1000 households.\n\nHouse building data are collected at local authority district level and are available on ODC [here](http://opendatacommunities.org/data/house-building/starts/tenure). Figures for annual house building starts are derived from live table [253](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/311426/LiveTable253.xlsx). A dwelling is counted as started on the date that work begins on the laying of the foundation, including 'slabbing' for houses that require it, but not including site preparation. \r\n\r\n\r\nHousehold figures are derived from 2012-based household projections by district, available on ODC [here](http://opendatacommunities.org/data/households/projections2012/households), or for download from published live tables as an [Excel spreadsheet](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/407641/Household_Projections_Published_Tables.ods). The assumptions underlying national household and population projections are based on demographic trends. They are not forecasts as, for example, they do not attempt to predict the impact of future Government policies, changing economic circumstances or other factors that might have influence household growth. The projections show the household numbers that would result if the assumptions based in previous demographic trends in the population and rates of household formation were to be realised in practice.\r\n",
