These policy designations are to be viewed in conjunction with Fareham Local Plan 2037 Adopted Policies Map. The Welborne Plan forms Part 3 of the Fareham Borough Local Plan and follows on from the adopted Fareham Borough Local Plan Part 1 (Core Strategy). Alongside Local Plan Part 2: Development Sites and Policies, these Plans provide the Borough with policies to encourage growth and investment in housing and jobs, whilst providing protection to the natural environment. All three parts of the Borough\u201fs Local Plan together with the Hampshire Minerals and Waste Plan (2013) form the Development Plan for Fareham Borough. The Development Plan is unique to each local authority area and provides the statutory framework or \u201erules\u201f for guiding decisions on planning applications in the area. Local Plan Part 3: The Welborne Plan was subject to examination by an independently appointed Government Planning Inspector, David Hogger BA MSc MRTPI MCIHT between July 2014 and May 2015.\r\nUse or download of this data means that you have accepted the terms of the INSPIRE End User Licence",
