        "notes": "This dataset contains daily micro-meteorological data from the experimental plots at the Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest, North East Wales. The data contain air temperature, (degrees celsius) soil temperature (degrees celsius) at 2 depths (5 and 20 centimetres) and soil moisture as metre cubed per metre cubed. The data run from 01/07/2015 until 31/08/2016. Data were recorded in minute intervals. Up to January 2016 the data were then averaged hourly, after January 2016 data were averaged half hourly. Data are then to averaged to daily values, which are reported here. The dataset has been quality checked, and incorrect or missing values removed, data has not been infilled. Climoor is a climate change manipulation experiment that utilises automated roof technology to produce drought and warming experimental treatments that reflect climate change predictions for the next 20 to 30 years. The reported plot level temperature and soil moisture data are important to evaluate the effect of the imposed climatic treatments on ecosystem processes and functioning. Data were not collected between 9th October 2015 and 3rd November 2015 due to problems with the sensors. Data collection, processing and quality checking were carried out by CEH Bangor staff members.
