        "notes": "Following experimental work carried out in 2013, a twin-rig trawler, the \nIlfracombe-based *Our Olivia Belle *(BD 277), was chartered to undertake \nfurther trials of a modified demersal trawl in August 2014 to look at \nselectivity in a mixed demersal fishery off south-west Cornwall. The primary \naim was to improve the selectivity of the trawl to reduce discards of unwanted \nhaddock with the least possible impact on the wanted catches of haddock and \nother commercial species. This is important in view of the future \nimplementation of the landings obligation and associated catch quotas for \nspecies such as haddock. Following discussions with several Newlyn-based \ntrawler operators, the decision was taken to investigate the effect of \ninserting square-mesh panels (SQMP) of 155 mm mesh into the top panel of the \nlengthener of an otter trawl. A twin-rig trawl, deployed as for normal haddock \nfishing, was used to compare the catches of modified and standard trawl nets \nin a series of tows on the fishing grounds off SW Cornwall.",
