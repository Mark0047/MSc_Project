        "notes": "This dataset is a subset of \"WFD Classification Status Cycle 2\" and contains classification data for the seagrass sub-element of the angiosperms element in transitional and coastal water bodies. Seagrasses are flowering plants that can provide habitats for a range of invertebrate and fish species and contribute to seafloor stability.  Seagrass beds are sensitive to physical disturbance which can destroy the beds and increase the suspended sediment in coastal waters.  They are also sensitive to secondary effects of elevated nutrients.  As such, they can be used to indicate the ecological status of transitional and coastal water bodies.  Metrics on seagrass diversity, density and the extent of meadows are run through the SAILOR classification tool.  This tool is currently suitable for use only with intertidal seagrass beds.  The actual (observed) scores for the three metrics are compared with a pre-defined reference score for each water body.  The comparison of the observed to expected scores is known as an Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR).  EQRs are used to produce a seagrass classification (High, Good, Moderate, Poor, Bad) of the water body for Water Framework Directive (WFD) purposes.
