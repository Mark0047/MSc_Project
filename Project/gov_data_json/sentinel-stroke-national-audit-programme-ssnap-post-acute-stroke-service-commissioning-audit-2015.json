        "notes": "In 2015 SSNAP carried out the first organisational audit of post-acute stroke service commissioning and availability in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The results for phase 1 of the audit, the post-acute stroke service commissioning audit, were published in June 2015. \r\n\r\nThe audit obtained information from 222/223 (99.6%) of commissioners (providers in Wales), including 211 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England, five Local Commissioning Groups (LCGs) in Northern Ireland and six Local Health Boards (LHBs) in Wales. Results provide the first national picture of post-acute stroke service commissioning and include information on the provision of Early Support Discharge (ESD), Communication Rehabilitation Teams (CRT), 6 month assessment review services and single disciplinary services. \r\n\r\nThe audit results describe the provision of post\u2010acute stroke services compared to recommendations for commissioners (providers in Wales), within the National Stroke guideline. The results reflect services commissioned on 1 December 2014. The post\u2010acute organisational audit complements the continuous SSNAP clinical audit which reports publically every 4 months on the process and outcomes of stroke care and includes post\u2010acute stroke teams.",
