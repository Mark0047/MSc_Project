The first was based around a 20-minute background interview and two skills assessments one for literacy and one for numeracy. On this basis respondents were assigned to one of 5 skill levels for both literacy and numeracy (Entry level 1 or below, Entry level 2, Entry level 3, Level 1, and Level 2 and above). The survey was clustered by wards within Government Office Regions and there were 8,730 interviews with adults in households aged 16-65, representing a 59% response rate of selected households. Non-response weights have been calculated for region, age and sex.",

In other words, a concern with reliability is integral to the method and expressed in terms of what Bayesian statisticians called 'credible intervals'. These are similar to the confidence intervals of classical statistics.  Therefore, 2.5% and 97.5% credible intervals were generated to accompany all local area estimates of the rates and numbers of people in the various literacy, numeracy and ICT skills levels. he survey was clustered by wards within Government Office Regions and there were 8,730 interviews with adults in households aged 16-65, representing a 59% response rate of selected households.",
