        "notes": "This British Geological Survey (BGS) marine geophysical, multibeam and sampling survey took place between the 10th September and 13th October 2007 in the areas of Moray Firth, Summer Isles, Nun Rock, Mingulay, Flannan, Loch Hourn, Loch Linnhe, Loch Nevis and island of Muck on board the RRS James Cook. The aim of the cruise was to collect sea-bed samples using the BGS 15m rock drill, BGS 6m vibrocorer, BGS gravity corer and site specific multibeam bathymetry and seismic data. The vessel was fitted with two multibeam echosounder systems (EM120 and EM710) and a sub-bottom seismic profiler system (Simrad SBP120). All of the data were recorded digitally and are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS Internal Report IR/08/004 (http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/507376/).",
