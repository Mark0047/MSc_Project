        "notes": "The clinical component of SSNAP prospectively collects a minimum dataset for every stroke patient since December 2012 to measure processes of acute care, rehabilitation and care in the community. SSNAP also collects outcome measures at 6 months. The aim is to improve the quality of stroke care by auditing stroke services against evidence based standards.\r\n\r\nThe latest SSNAP periodic report presents national and named team results for the entire inpatient stroke care pathway. It is based on patients admitted or discharged from hospital in the most recent 4-monthly time period.\r\n\r\nThis report contains results for important measures of inpatient stroke care including stroke unit care, thrombolysis, therapy assessments and intensity, timings of interventions, and discharge standards. It also provides comparisons where appropriate against the previous 3 periodic reports to show changes over time.\r\n\r\nA SSNAP scoring system has been derived to enable hospitals to compare their performance against other hospitals and benchmark against the national result. This summary of performance is based upon results for 44 key indicators which are grouped into 10 domains covering key aspects of stroke care. An overall score is calculated from domain scores adjusted for case ascertainment and audit compliance. Please see technical guidance for details about how the SSNAP scores are calculated.\r\n\r\nExtremely high standards have been set with the aim of stimulating hospitals to identify where improvements are needed and drive change. Nowhere else in the world has set as stringent standards and the results should be read in this context.\r\n\r\nSSNAP Summary Results: This excel file contains summary information by named team for 44 key indicators within 10 domains of care in addition to measures of overall performance based on the SSNAP scoring system.\r\n\r\nFull Results Portfolio: This is a very detailed file containing results for every stroke measure collected by SSNAP. It is intended as a reference document for those who wish to drill-down in more detail than the summary results.",
