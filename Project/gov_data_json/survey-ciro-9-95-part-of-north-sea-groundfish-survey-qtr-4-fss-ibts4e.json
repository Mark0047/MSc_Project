Station, catch, \nlength (all species) and biological data (selected species) are collected \nusing research vessels and GOV trawls. Benthic catches are also recorded. The \nsurveys are carried out in support of EU data regulations and as part of the \nInternation Bottom Trawl survey. Additional aims include collection of water \ntemperature, salinity and litter data.\n\nSurvey took place between 14/10/1995 and 12/11/1995 on Cirolana\n\nEquipment used during this survey :\n\n\n-   Bottle Casts Nansen bottles Reversing surface and bottom\n-   Otter Trawl GOV 36/47 IBTS spec with 6 Balmoral Kites, 50 floats, metal \n    discs in footrope\n-   Otter Trawl GOV Long Wing 36/47 Standard IYFS Spec.\n\nSurvey operations were undertaken on 160 stations\n\n176 different species were caught on this survey",
