        "notes": "This dataset was collated to provide evidence for supporting and investing in the high growth screen industries sector in the Thames Estuary region. This evidence base was created as part of a research commission funded by MHCLG in 2020, which set out to make a case for investment in cultural infrastructure across the region.\u00a0\n\nThis document provides a summary of the screen industries sector research undertaken from July to December 2021. It presents an overview of key findings based on the quantitative and qualitative research to map, profile and understand the baseline and trajectory of the screen sector in the Thames Estuary. It also summarises qualitative evidence and key points provided by stakeholders through consultation.\n\nIn terms of the geography covered, Thames Estuary Production Corridor includes 18 local authority areas across east London, north Kent and south Essex. The London boroughs include are: Havering, Tower Hamlets, Bexley, Lewisham, Greenwich, Newham and Barking & Dagenham \u2013 these boroughs are the ones represented in the sector analysis. Both reports contain a methodology on page 3 which describes how the evidence has been gathered.",
