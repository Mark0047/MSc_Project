        "notes": "This spatial dataset contains the digital boundaries of National Nature Reserves (NNRs) in Wales. NNRs represent the very best examples of our wildlife habitats and geological features and can range in size between five hectares to well over 2,000. NNR are declared by Natural Resources Wales (NRW) under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act of 1949, or under the Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981. They are owned or leased by NRW, or the land is held by an approved body, such as a County Wildlife Trust. Each reserve has a programme of work to manage the site's special features. All of them are also Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and may provide places for educational projects, research and management trials. Some reserves require permits to gain acce\nss to them. NNRs are designated over a number of years, beginning in 1954 and on going. This data has been checked by NRW staff. The original, individual, declaration paper maps are the legal documents.",
