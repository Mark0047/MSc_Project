For example, people live nearby or there are other types of sensitive accommodation such as schools, hospitals. The road network dominates Leicester\u2019s zone of exceedance: it comprises the city centre, an area 10m either side of the inner ring road and all major arterial roads. Beyond 10m of the roads, levels of pollution drop as air movement allows dispersion of the exhaust emissions.",
