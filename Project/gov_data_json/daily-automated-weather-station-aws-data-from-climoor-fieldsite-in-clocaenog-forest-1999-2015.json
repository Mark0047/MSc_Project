        "notes": "This dataset contains daily automated weather station (AWS) data from the Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest, North East Wales. The data are air temperature (mean, minimum and maximum), rainfall, net radiation, solar radiation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), wind speed and direction. The dataset has been quality checked, and incorrect or missing values removed, data has not been infilled. Data runs from 12/6/1999 until 30/06/2015, no data was collected March 2006 and June 2008. Air temperature, rainfall and wind speed and direction were recorded since June 1999. Measurements of relative humidity, air pressure, net and solar radiation and PAR started in June 2008. Since June 2008, data are recorded in minute intervals, averaged to hourly, then to daily means that are reported here. The Climoor field experiment intends to answer questions regarding the effects of warming and drought on ecosystem processes. The reported data are collected to monitor site specific environmental conditions and their development with time. These data are important to interpret results that are collected from the climate change manipulations imposed in the field. Full details about this dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5285/7f2a4935-a9e8-47dc-b126-93d9e19496bd",
