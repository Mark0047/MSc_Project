Samples for a number of chemical and biological analyses were collected. The analysis undertaken on the sediment samples collected were: total organic carbon and total organic nitrogen; total hydrocarbon and n-alkane content; and 2 to 6 ring polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) content. Excel files containing the data are also available.",
