These water bodies are divided into \u201cimpacted\u201d and \u201cprobably impacted\u201d depending on the significance of pollution; impacted water bodies are polluted all of the time, probably impacted means the pollution is not always significant at the water body scale. Each water body has been allocated a score based on the magnitude of the metal EQS failure, and impacts on ecology and groundwater. The system for scoring impacts is adapted from the methodology described in \"Prioritisation of abandoned non-coal mine impacts on the environment: A methodology for identification and prioritisation of abandoned non-coal mines in England and Wales\" published by the Environment Agency in 2012 (available from gov.uk).
