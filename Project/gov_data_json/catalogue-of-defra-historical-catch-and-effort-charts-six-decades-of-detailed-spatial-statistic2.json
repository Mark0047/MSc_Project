More specifically, \nthey show the annual and monthly landings and catch rates per fish species, \nand the fishing effort for various components of the British commercial \nfishing fleet. These values are indicated separately for each rectangle of 1\u00b0 \nlongitude by 30' latitude (equivalent to International Council for the \nExploration of the Sea [ICES] rectangles) as well as for the entire area \ncharted (generally equivalent to ICES fishing areas).",
