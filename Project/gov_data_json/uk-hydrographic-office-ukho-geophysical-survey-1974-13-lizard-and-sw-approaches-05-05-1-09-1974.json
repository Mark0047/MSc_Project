These purpose was to collect data to link deep seismic information to the outcrop geology. Sea floor data were collected using Echo Sounder, Gravimeter, Magnetometer, Sidescan Sonar. Sub-bottom profiling data were collected using Sparker. These data are archived by BGS. Details of the survey are contained in IGS Annual Report 1974.",
