        "notes": "Cod (*Gadus morhua*) stocks in the North Sea have declined to historically \nlow levels of abundance and are considered to be suffering from a reduced \nability to reproduce. In this situation there is considerable concern about \nthe way in which climate change may affect the ability of these stocks to \nrecover. Theoretical studies based on the effects of temperature on growth and \nspawning success or recruitment suggest that increases in temperature may \nresult in the decline and subsequent disappearance of cod from the North Sea. \nConsequently it is useful to look at long time series data to see whether \nthere is evidence for direct impacts of temperature changes on cod.\n\nData includes otolith age, length and growth increment measurements, as well \nas high resolution photographs.",
