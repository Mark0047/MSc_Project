Video transects with habitat characterisation across Wight-Barfleur Reef candidate Special Area of Conservation (cSAC)\nVideo footage was collected during the following survey:\nSurvey of Wight-Barfleur Reef cSAC aboard RV Cefas Endeavour, cruise code CEND0313, between 18/03/2013 and 27/03/2013\nSurvey of Wight-Barfleur Extension rMCZ aboard RV Cefas Endeavour, cruise code CEND0312, between 27/02/2012 and 28/02/2012\nIn addition, data extracted from selected video samples (i.e., thosefalling inside the Wight-BarfleurReefcSAC boundary) acquired during the following survey were also included in analyses:\nSurvey for the project 'Broadscale mapping of hard substrates in the central English Channel' (ME1102), conducted aboard RV Cefas Endeavour, cruise code CEND1406, between 03/08/2006 and 06/08/2006\nIn total,174 videosamples were interpreted, 123 from CEND0313, 29 from CEND0312, and 22 from CEND1406. A drop-camera was used in all three survey; the position reference point for coordinates was the side gantry. Video transects were plotted by joining the position coordinates of all sequential still images taken within each video sample. Drop-camera deployments lasted a minimum of 10 minutes, with the vessel executing a controlled drift at ~ 0.5 knots (~0.25 ms?1) across a 50 m bullring centred on the sampling station. Still images were captured at regular one minute intervals and opportunistically if specific features of interest were encountered. The camera was deployed from the side gantry, with the height of the camera off the seabed being controlled by a winch operator with sight of the video monitor.",
