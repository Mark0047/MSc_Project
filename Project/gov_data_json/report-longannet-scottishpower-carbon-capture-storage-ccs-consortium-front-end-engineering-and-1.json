        "notes": "In March 2010, the Scottish CCS (Carbon Capture & Storage) Consortium began an extensive Front End, Engineering and Design (FEED) study to assess what would be required from an engineering, commercial and regulatory, perspective in order to progress the CCS demonstration project at Longannet Power station in Scotland through to construction. The study yielded invaluable knowledge and the resulting material are available for download here. This section of the report contains a high-level monthly summary of the total costs incurred performing the Consortium's FEED study. This information is provided with the aim of enabling potential developers of CCS projects to estimate up front FEED costs. A detailed cost breakdown is also provided for each of the key parties within the Consortium in the form of Cost, Time and Resource (CTR) information in PDFs below, under the following references: UKCCS - KT - S1.0 - SP - 001 ScottishPower CTR Summary; UKCCS - KT - S1.0 - ACC - 001 Aker Clean Carbon CTR Summary; UKCCS - KT - S1.0 - NG - 001 National Grid CTR Summary; UKCCS - KT - S1.0 - Shell - 001 Shell CTR Summary; The detailed CTR information provides a breakdown of the actual labour effort used for the totality of the FEED scope of work, presented by month and by CTR activity, the type of expertise used, the number of hours worked and the associated costs. The split between internal and external costs is shown, together with the original budget estimates developed for each CTR prior to commencing FEED. The appropriate summary section from the Feed Close Out Report can be downloaded as a PDF (FEED cost.pdf). The main text of the FEED Close Out Report, together with the supporting appendix for this section can be downloaded as PDF files.
