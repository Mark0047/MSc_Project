New Flood Zones will be available when the new Flood Map for Planning is published at the end of Summer 2021.\r\nThe Flood Map shows the areas across Wales that could be affected by flooding from rivers or the sea. It also shows flood defences and the areas that benefit from them. Flood Map is designed to raise awareness among the public local authorities and other organisations of the likelihood of flooding and to encourage people living and working in areas prone to flooding to find out more and take appropriate action. The Flood Map includes several layers of information, this layer is: Flood Zone 3, which is NRWs best estimate of the areas of land with a 100 to 1 (or greater) chance of flooding each year from rivers or with a 200 to 1 chance (or greater) of flooding each year from the sea.\r\n    ",
