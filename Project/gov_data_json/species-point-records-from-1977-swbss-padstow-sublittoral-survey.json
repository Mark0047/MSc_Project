        "notes": "The survey was planned in order to describe the range of sublittoral habitats and populations in the region of Padstow, to provide information for Underwater Conservation Year projects, and to give divers interested in natural history, the opportunity to take part in a field survey working with biologists involved in marine studies. 27 km of coastline including offshore rocks from Trevone Head to Port Issac were involved in the survey. Along most of the coast, a sand plain or gentle slope extended into shallow water at around 5 m. At headlands and offshore rocks, stable and often very broken rock substrates were present to 20 m and deeper. A distinct infralittoral fringe was present near to Chart Datum level followed by an upper infralittoral zone characterised by the presence of kelp forest which extended to only about 3 m. Algal populations were distinctly different in exposed and semi-exposed sites. The lower infralittoral zone dominated by foliaceous algae extended to 13 m and was followed by a circalittoral zone. Population types and richness is also discussed. Kellan Head is noted as the richest circalittoral site visited during the survey. 27 sites were surveyed. 99 species of algae and 158 species of animals were recorded. Records currently considered sensitive have been removed from this dataset.",
