The data are separated by \ninput loads from the UK, the OSPAR countries and other countries outside the \nOSPAR area. The data are presented in two CSV files. One is called data_metal \ninputs indicator assessment and the other in called \nRID_Data_Input_Hg_Cd_Pb_Indicator_Assessment. The former provides the yearly \ninput loads of the three contaminants from the UK rivers, the atmospheric \ndeposition from OSPAR and non-OSPAR countries. The later break down the UK \nspecific riverine input loads including the flow rates.",
