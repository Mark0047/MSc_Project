        "notes": "Making clinical audit data transparent\r\n\r\nIn his transparency and open data letter to Cabinet Ministers on 7 July 2011, the Prime Minister made a commitment to make clinical audit data available from the national audits within the National Clinical Audit and Patient Outcomes Programme. \r\n\r\nThe information available from this webpage comes from the National Bowel Cancer Audit. The Audit covers Strategic Clinical Networks and NHS Trusts in England and Wales.\r\n\r\nWhat information is being made available? \r\n\uf0a7\tAudit participation by NHS Trust and data completeness for the key fields\r\n\uf0a7\tMeasures about the process of care given to patients \r\n\uf0a7\tInformation about care outcomes and treatment. \r\nThese data do not list individual patient information nor do they contain any patient identifiable data. \r\n\r\nUsing and interpreting the data \r\n\r\nData from the National Bowel Cancer Audit requires careful interpretation, and the information should not be looked at in isolation when assessing standards of care. \r\n\r\nData are provided by place of surgery in secondary care for the period 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013. As a result, some trusts that only provide some specialist treatments for patients and do not supply surgical data are not fully represented in these data. We estimate the number of patients diagnosed at each trust from the Hospital Episode Statistics database and that number provides the \u2018denominator' for the case ascertainment. It is much more difficult to define a population denominator for specialist centres because patients treated there have often been diagnosed elsewhere, and the treatment they provide is usually only one part of a complex care pathway. Therefore their performance should not be assessed from the results as published here. These trusts do however fully participate in the audit by providing treatment data for the referring trusts. \r\n\r\nAccessing the data \r\n\r\nThe data are being made available on the data.gov website. Each year files of data from the National Bowel Cancer Audit will be made available in CSV format. Trusts and Networks are identified by name and their national code. \r\n\r\nWhat does the data cover? \r\n\r\nThe data measure levels of completeness for data submitted to the National Bowel Cancer Audit and measures of performance in the audit at trust level for key performance measures for assessing standards of care for bowel cancer in secondary care. Details of these standards can be found in the appendices of the National Bowel Cancer Audit Report 2014. \r\n\r\nAre all Trusts included? \r\n\r\nAll Trusts in England that manage patients diagnosed with bowel cancer are included. \r\n\r\nWhat period does the data cover? \r\n\r\nThis data covers patients with a date of diagnosis between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2013.",

HQIP is an independent organisation led by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, The Royal College of Nursing, and National Voices and it works in partnership with patients and healthcare professionals to influence and improve healthcare practice at all levels. \r\n\r\nHQIP commissions, manages, supports, and promotes national and local programmes of quality improvement. This includes the national clinical audit programmes, the Clinical Outcome Review Programmes and the National Joint Registry on behalf of NHS England and other healthcare departments and organisations.  \r\n\r\nIn compliance with its commissioning status, HQIP:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Uses best management and procurement practice to ensure robust results and actionable recommendations.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Ensures patients and carers remain at the heart of its work through continued, strategic involvement in all relevant processes and projects.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Supports professionals to review and improve their practice by providing education and training programmes, and opportunities to share best practice as part of promoting an integrated approach to quality improvement.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Works to inform and influence national healthcare policy by effectively communicating its work and that of its partners.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Encourages wide use of robust data for quality improvement of care, offering patient choice, promoting patient safety, supporting revalidation and service accreditation, commissioning, service redesign, and research.\r\n\r\nFurther information about the HQIP Board, the team, and the organisations that HQIP work with is available on the HQIP website at http://www.hqip.org.uk/about-us/.",
