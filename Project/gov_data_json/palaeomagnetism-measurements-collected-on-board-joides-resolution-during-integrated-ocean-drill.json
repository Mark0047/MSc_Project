        "notes": "The dataset created includes natural remanent magnetisation (NRM) of archive-half core sections recovered at nine sites (i.e. Sites U1422, U1423, U1424, U1425, U1426, U1427, U1428, U1429, and U1430) during IODP Expedition 346. NRM of the archive-half core sections were measured at every 5-cm interval resolution before and after 20-mT alternating field (AF) demagnetisation treatment. The dataset created also includes NRM of discrete samples taken from working-half core sections (typically one discrete sample per core from the longest hole at each drilling site). NRM of discrete samples were measured before and after a complete stepwise AF demagnetisation routine (up to 60-mT peak AF field). All NRM data collected were used to construct magnetostratigraphy for all sites drilled during Expedition 346. All data have been published in IODP proceedings Volume 346 (http://publications.iodp.org/proceedings/346/346toc.htm).",
