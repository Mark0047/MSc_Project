        "notes": "This dataset contains the ratio of lower quartile/median house price to lower quartile/median earnings in England\r\n\n\nThis dataset uses the median/lower quartile house price data sourced from ONS House Price Statistics for Small Areas (HPSSA) statistical release for years 2013-2015 and house price data sourced directly from Land Registry prior to 2013. This leads to slight differences in the distribution of affordability ratios before and after 2013 which should be noted if the dataset is used as a time series. It is planned to update the ratios with the HPSSA dataset for all years in the future. \r\n\r\nThe house price data is then compared to the median/lower quartile income data of full time workers from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) produced by the ONS.\r\n\r\nThis data was derived from Table 576 and 577, available for download as an Excel spreadsheet from the Live tables page (https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-housing-market-and-house-prices). More details about the data sources are also available in the link provided.\r\n",
