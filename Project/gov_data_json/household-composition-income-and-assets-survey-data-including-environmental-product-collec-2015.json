        "notes": "This dataset includes data collected as part of the Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services (ACES) project on the composition, income (including consumption and sale of environmental resources), ownership of assets (e.g. farming equipment, household furnishings and own transport) and wellbeing of respondent households in rural Mozambique. Data are also included from a participatory wealth ranking exercise carried out in each village. Data were collected in a total of 27 villages: 7 villages in Mabalane District in Gaza Province, 10 villages in Guru\u00e9 District in Zambezia Province and 10 villages in Marrupa District in Niassa Province. Data collection was carried out in 2014 and 2015, using a one-off environmentally-augmented household income and assets survey administered by enumerators in the locally appropriate language. The objective of the ACES project was to explore interactions between woodland change, ecosystem services and wellbeing in rural Mozambican households. The study used a space-for-time substitution approach, with villages in each district chosen to represent different points on gradients of land use intensity with respect to the dominant land use types in each district (charcoal production in Mabalane, commercial agriculture in Guru\u00e9 and subsistence agriculture in Marrupa). Data were collected primarily by researchers based in the School of Geosciences at the University of Edinburgh and at the University of Eduardo Mondlane in Mozambique. All the data collected using the household survey are included in this dataset barring those data which would compromise the anonymity of respondents, such as the names and household coordinates of those interviewed.
