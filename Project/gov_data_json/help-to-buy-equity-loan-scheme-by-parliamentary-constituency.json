        "notes": "This data set contains Help to Buy: Equity Loan statistics at parliamentary constituency level.  \r\n\r\nThe figures cover the launch of the scheme on 1 April 2013 until 31\r\n October 2014. \n\nFigures have been attributed to an individual constituency by reconciling data against the ONS Postcode Directory (May 2014) where possible. Figures for some constituencies may be subject to revision later in the year.\r\n\r\n. For sales before 31 March 2014, properties are included under the local authority district to \r\nwhich they were initially allocated. In some cases, this differs from latest information, which forms the basis of the first column of local \r\nauthority district figures. Figures for some local authorities may be subject to revisions later in the year. Although local authority \r\ninformation is validated against other geographic data at the time of data entry, detailed reconciliation of the data, conducted twice a year, \r\nmay result in a small number of changes to these monthly releases, for example where a new development crosses a local authority boundary. \t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAn equity loan is Government financial assistance given to eligible applicants to purchase an eligible home through a Government equity mortgage \r\nsecured on the home. The Government equity mortgage is ranked second in priority behind an owner\u2019s main mortgage lender. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis scheme offers up to 20 per cent of the value as Government assistance to purchasers buying a new build home. The buyer must provide a cash deposit of\r\nat least 5 per cent and a main mortgage lender must provide a loan of at least 75 per cent. \r\n\r\nThe Government assistance to buy is made through an \r\nequity loan made by the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) to the purchaser. \r\n\r\nHelp to Buy equity loans are only available on new build homes and the maximum purchase price is \u00a3600,000. Equity loan assistance for purchasers \r\nis paid via house builders registered with the HCA to participate in the Help to Buy equity loan initiative. The payment is made to builders \r\n(via solicitors) at purchaser legal completion. \r\n\r\nThe equity loan is provided without fees for the first five years of ownership. \r\n\r\nThe property title is held by the home owner who can therefore sell their home at any time and upon sale should provide the government the value \r\nof the same equity share of the property when it is sold.\r\n\r\nFor further information see  \r\n[Help to Buy (equity loan) scheme monthly statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/help-to-buy-equity-loan-scheme-monthly-statistics).\r\n",
