        "notes": "This National Oceanography Centre (NOC) marine geophysical and multibeam survey took place in May/June 2011 on board the RRS James Cook. This data is a subset from the survey collected as a MAREMAP initiative at BGS request over BGS borehole BH78/4. Sea floor data bathymetry were collected using EM710 and sub bottom seismic profiling data were gathered using a SBP120. Other data from the survey are held at NOC. Survey details contained in NOC cruise report No. 4. The cruise was related to and supported by the NERC MAREMAP programme, the EC FP7 IP HERMIONE (grant agreement 226354) and the ERC Starting Grant project CODEMAP (ERC Grant 258482). Additional funding to support ROV work was obtained from the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) and the Lenfest Ocean Program/PEW Foundation. Any published material resulting from these data (Stornoway Bay) must include in the acknowledgements text acknowledging the acquisition cruise, its funding streams and chief scientist (V A I Huvenne).",
