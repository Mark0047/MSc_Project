To determine whether a student belongs to this group, a set of criteria known as 'trigger criteria' has been established. These criteria state that students must be aged 16, 17 or 18 (at the start of the academic year), and they must have been entered for a GCE/VCE A level, or a VCE Double Award in the summer session of the academic year.
