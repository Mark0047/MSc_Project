Municipal waste to landfill will include that residual waste sent directly to landfill and that which was collected for other management routes e.g. recycling, Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) but subsequently sent to landfill.\r\nSource: WasteDataFlow system\r\nPublisher: DCLG Floor Targets Interactive\r\nGeographies: County/Unitary Authority, Government Office Region (GOR), National\r\nGeographic coverage: England\r\nTime coverage: 2002/03 to 2008/09\r\nType of data: Administrative data\r\nNotes: The scope of municipal waste is the same as the European Union Landfill Directive and Landfill Allowances Trading Scheme (LATS). DEFRA's view is that the definition of municipal waste in the Landfill Directive and LATS encompasses all waste in the possession or under the control of a waste disposal authority or a waste collection authority, or agents acting on their behalf.\r\nGuidelines: Good performance is typified by a lower percentage.",
