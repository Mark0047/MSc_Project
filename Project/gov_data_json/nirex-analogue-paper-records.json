It is the availability of this paper archive of results and interpretation that makes the Nirex geological archives of rock cores and samples unique. The ownership of NIREX (Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Executive) was transferred from the nuclear industry to the UK Government departments DEFRA and DTI in April 2005, and then to the UK's Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) in November 2006.",
