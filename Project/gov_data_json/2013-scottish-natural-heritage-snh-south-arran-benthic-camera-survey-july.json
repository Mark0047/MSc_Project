        "notes": "The purpose of this benthic survey around South Arran, Clyde sea was to improve knowledge of the occurrence and distribution of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance, particuarly proposed protected features (PPFs) and other priority marine features (PMFs). An underwater video survey were conducted by SNH for SNH on the 15th and 16th July 2013 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 21 sites. The images were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. SNH used the vessel Sir John Murray for this survey.",
