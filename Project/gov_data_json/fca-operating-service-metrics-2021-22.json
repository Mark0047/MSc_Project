It covers 47 operating service metrics on activities including dealing with regulatory applications, telephone enquiries and other correspondence. It also provides enforcement data to show the enforcement action the FCA took. This data focuses on the FCA's performance for the period 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022.",
