        "notes": "This marine geophysical survey undertaken by Institute of Geological Sciences (BGS) took place in August 1972 in the Malin/Clyde areas on board the M.V. Researcher. The survey was carried out as part of a regional mapping programme. Data were gathered for Project:72/6 using the following Navigation: Decca Main Chain; MS32 Echo-sounder; Gravitymeter: La Coste and Romberg - the output was poor, Askania GSS-3 - The meter performed badly in rough seas; Magnetometer; Pinger and Sparker, 1000 nautical miles were covered in a grid of 55 lines. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS Internal Report WB/ MG/72/37.",
