The applicant will need to demonstrate in their operating schedule that there will be no negative cumulative impact on one or more of the licensing objectives in order to rebut any such presumption. \r\n\r\nThe boundaries have been created over OS MasterMap based on several factors such us crimes rates, ambulance and emergency services, noise, cost benefit analysis and behaviour studies. This insight was used to propose two Special Policy Areas which were consulted and reviewed.  ",
