Public Health England. https://doi.org/10.25503/c0pp-sa20.  \r\n\r\nAggregated data on skin cancer tumours (ICD-10 C43x - C44x) diagnosed from 1995 - 2017 in the English resident population.  This dataset includes counts grouped by age group, sex, and diagnosis year for all melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers. The age_group variable includes five-year age bands with the exception of those aged 0-14, which are grouped together. Sex is denoted by either '1', which indicates male records, or '2', which indicates female records. The diagnosisyear variable denotes the year of diagnosis for those records. The icd10_code show the ICD-10 site code.\r\n\r\nWhenever it is possible and practicable to do so, data released by PHE will be anonymous and made available under an Open Government License.
