        "notes": "This record is for Approval for Access product AfA159. This dataset contains details of currently permitted waste carriers, brokers and dealers. Lower tier registrations are indefinite however upper tier need renewing every 3 years. Historical details are not included.\n\nLive data can be downloaded from the electronic Public Register:\nhttps://environment.data.gov.uk/public-register/view/search-waste-carriers-brokers\n\nCarrier: A person who transports controlled waste in the course of a business or otherwise with a view to profit.\nBroker: Waste brokers are people who make arrangements, on behalf of others, to recover or dispose of waste, regardless of whether or not they handle the waste themselves.\nDealer: Waste dealers are people who buy then sell wastes, regardless of whether or not they handle the waste themselves.\nExempt activities: People who do not need to register because of a specific exemption in the regulations;  \n- the operator of certain vessels and vehicles where the activity of waste carriage is for the purpose of a specified marine operation and the activity requires a marine licence or can be carried out under a marine exemption\n- any lower tier carrier who does not normally and regularly transport controlled waste \n- until after 2013, the existing exemption for carriers who only transport their own waste (unless it is construction and demolition waste) will remain in place.\nExcluded persons: People who are excluded from the requirement to register. These include:\n- Any person who carries controlled wastes but not as part of their business or otherwise for profit \n- Ferry operators carrying vehicles that are carrying waste\n- Any person carrying waste between different places belonging to the same premises.\n- Any person carrying waste by air or sea, from a place in Great Britain to any place outside Great Britain\n- Any person carrying waste from a country outside of Great Britain to the first point of arrival\nWaste Carriers, Dealers and Brokers are a combined dataset. Operators shift between categories frequently, and so separate datasets could be misleading. Extracting a single type would be extremely time consuming and cost-prohibitive.
