        "notes": "The data pertains to a single time point 'snapshot' spatial sampling of site characteristics, soil parameters and soil greenhouse gas emissions for two sites (Extensive and Intensive). The extensively managed site ('Extensive'; 240-340 m above sea level; a.s.l.) consisted of an 11.5 ha semi-improved, sheep-grazed pasture at Bangor University's Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (53\u00b013'13''N, 4\u00b00'34''W). The intensively managed site ('Intensive'; on average 160 m a.s.l.) was a 1.78 ha sheep-grazed pasture located in south-west England, at the North Wyke Farm Platform (NWFP), Rothamsted Research, Okehampton, Devon (50\u00b046'10''N, 30\u00b054'05''W). At the Extensive site soil and gas sampling was conducted on 30th November 2016. At the Intensive site soil and gas sampling was conducted on 1st August 2016. The data contains: site characteristics including elevation, slope, compound topographic index, vegetation type or manure application, and sample point grid references; soil parameters including soil bulk density, soil percentage water-filled pore space, soil moisture, soil organic matter contents, soil pH, soil nitrate nitrogen concentration, soil ammonium nitrogen concentration, soil percentage total carbon contents, soil percentage total nitrogen contents, and carbon to nitrogen content ratio; and soil greenhouse gas flux data for nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide and methane. The study was conducted as a wider part of the NERC funded Uplands-N2O project and BBSRC-supported Rothamsted Research, North Wyke Farm Platform (Grant Nos: NE/M015351/1, NE/M013847/1, NE/M013154/1, BBS/E/C/000J0100, BBS/E/C/000I0320, BBS/E/C/000I0330). Quantifying the spatial and variability of the drivers of greenhouse gas emissions and their interactions in grazing systems is critical to improve our understanding of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide and methane fluxes, enabling better estimates of aggregated greenhouse gas emissions and associated uncertainties at the landscape scale.
