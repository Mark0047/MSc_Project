Data are supplied from official sources, companies and trade associations. Where data cannot be acquired, estimates are given. In addition to UK (country) data, statistics are also given at planning region level and, for certain minerals, at county level. Units of measurements are tonnes, kilograms or carats, according to commodity. Value is also provided for imports and exports. The information will be of value to all those interested in Britain's minerals. The data captured by BGS spans from 1973 onwards and is updated annually.",
