        "notes": "This marine geophysical survey of Beaufort's Dyke, North Channel took place in May 2008 aboard the RV Corystes. The British Geological Survey were invited to participate in the survey by AFBI (Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute). Subsequent additions to the AFBI programme allowed BGS to run seismic over the Pisces Reef in the northwest Irish Sea and off the Antrim coast. The purpose was to gather data which could be used to provide seismic profiling of features identified on the multibeam bathymetry data to aid interpretation. Three areas were surveyed and good quality data were collected in 35 survey tracks. Subsurface seismic data were gathered by using a sparker. The data were recorded digitally, but paper records were generated also. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS Internal Report IR/08/38.
