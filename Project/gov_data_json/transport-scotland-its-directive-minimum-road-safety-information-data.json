        "notes": "The ITS Directive and UK traffic and lorry parking data\r\n\r\nThe UK Department for Transport and the devolved administrations are taking an opportunity offered by the European ITS Directive to improve access to open transport-related data and encourage its reuse.  This will create new opportunities for services and research and ultimately benefit the travelling public.\r\n\r\nAll organisations which collect or create traffic and lorry parking data on any part of the UK TEN-T network may fall within the EU legislation known as the ITS Directive.  Private sector companies are entitled to charge for accessing and reusing their data.\r\n\r\nThe designated data must be made available via an access point.  The UK Department for Transport is building on the established Government open data portal www.data.gov.uk to provide this access point, rather than create a new access mechanism.  This approach will further encourage the opening up and reuse of data.  \r\n\r\nThe Delegated Regulation associated with this dataset is:\r\nRoad safety related traffic information\r\nCouncil of the European Union - Commission Delegated Regulation of 15 May 2013 supplementing Directive 2010/40/EU (\u201cthe ITS Directive\u201d) of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to data and procedures for the provision, where possible, of road safety-related minimum universal traffic information free of charge to users.\r\n\r\nFor more detailed information about the ITS Directive and how we are using it to improve access to UK traffic and lorry parking data, see https://data.gov.uk/intelligent-transport-systems\r\n\r\nEnquiries are welcome to directive@its-uk.org.uk \r\n \r\nThis data consists of:  Unplanned Events, Current Roadworks, Future Roadworks, VMS, VMS Table\r\nThis data is updated twice daily.  Accuracy is very high.  \r\n\r\nIt is generated by cameras, loops, on-road reporting by Transport Scotland officers, road works diary updated by operating companies.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about, and subscribe to, this data please email datex2@trafficscotland.org \r\n",
