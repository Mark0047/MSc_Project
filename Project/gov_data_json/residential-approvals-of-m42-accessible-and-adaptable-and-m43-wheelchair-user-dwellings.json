The data is broken down by borough and year.\n\nInformation on individual applications can be found on the [Planning London Datahub](https://planningdata.london.gov.uk/dashboard/), or on our [Residential Approvals dashboard](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/residential-approvals-dashboard). Completions can be viewed at [Residential Completions dashboard](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/residential-completions-dashboard)\n\n  \n\nPlease note that compliance with part M of the building regulations is not confirmed at application stage, but must be included as a condition on the decision notice when planning permission is granted. We are currently working with London's planning authorities to ensure that the PLD is being correctly updated with the M4 compliance information at the time the decision is issued. The data is therefore currently assumed to under represent the true picture. The dashboard will automatically update as more data becomes available.",
