Doctors issue fit notes to individuals to provide evidence of the advice the doctor has given about the individual\u2019s fitness for work.  Information about how these fit notes are completed can give us the first ever large-scale picture of sickness absence across England, Scotland and Wales. An important caveat is that this will not be a universal picture \u2013 GPs are not compelled to use electronic fit notes and can use hand-written fit notes if they wish. About 25% of GP practices in England also do not have access to the electronic fit note. ",
