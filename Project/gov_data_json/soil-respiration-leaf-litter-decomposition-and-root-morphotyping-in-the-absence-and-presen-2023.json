        "notes": "[This dataset is embargoed until November 30, 2025]. The data encompass measurements in soil and litter, including leaf litter decomposition, soil respiration, and root morphology analysis in the absence and presence of tree roots in the UK. Data were collected in two locations, Alice Holt and Thetford, UK, in October-November 2023, under three different treatments: 1. Root trenching and root ingrowth prevention: roots were severed from the tree in a 2x2 meter area, and a membrane preventing root ingrowth was inserted into the soil, resulting a free of living space. 2. Root trenching: roots were severed from the tree in a 2x2 meter area, but new roots were allowed to grow in that space. 3. Control: The soil remained undisturbed, with no intervention.
