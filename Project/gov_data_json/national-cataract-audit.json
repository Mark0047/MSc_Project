        "notes": "Data for the third prospective year of the National Cataract Audit. The data was collected as part of routine clinical care on electronic medical record systems in 101 participating centres. The three metrics used in the national cataract audit are case ascertainment and adjusted rates for posterior capsular rupture and visual acuity loss. The denominator for case ascertainment was the number of cataract operations reported to NHS digital and NHS Wales informatics Service (NWIS) performed using phacoemulsification. Operative data is more consistent than post-operative data as not all centres use the electronic medical record systems in all areas of their hospital eye service. Post-operative results do not include operations performed in the last 2 months of the audit year. Results are provided for contributing NHS Trusts, Welsh Health Boards and Independent Sector Treatment Centres (ISTC). The results for Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust include patients from Airedale Hospital NHS Foundation Trust as cataract surgery for Airedale patients is performed in Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust sites. Results for Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust includes data from Bedford Hospital NHS Trust and Croydon Health Services NHS Trust.",
