More specifically, 20 carp were bath \nchallenged with KHV (E1-E20) for four hours at 23 degrees Celsius. Five \ncontrol carp were mock challenged under the same conditions (CA-CE). KHV \nchallenged and control fish were maintained in separate locations but under \nthe same conditions. Fish were fed up to 40 food pellets daily and the number \nof uneaten pellets counted each day. In addition each fish was netted daily \nand samples of mucus collected by cutting out sections of net containing mucus \nand placing in centrifuge tubes. Viral titres in mucus were quantified using \nreal time PCR. Fish were held until they either succumbed to the disease or \nwere terminally anaesthetised when moribund. Survivors were terminally \nanaesthetised with benzocaine.",
