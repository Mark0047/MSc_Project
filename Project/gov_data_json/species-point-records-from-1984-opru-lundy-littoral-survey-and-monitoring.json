        "notes": "Lundy shores have been studied over many years, providing a good descriptive basis for the assessment of the scientific interest of the area and for the location of sites and species of high conservation importance. The current status of Lundy as a voluntary marine nature reserve and the work being undertaken to obtain statutory designation make it important to understand the dynamics of littoral communities on Lundy and particularly of species of high scientific interest so that management is based on a good knowledge of the natural fluctuations and sensitivity of communities and species. The work undertaken in April 1984 was carried out to: 1. describe shore communities present at locations around Lundy, particularly in areas of high conservation interest or where little or no survey work had previously been carried out (Management Plan Project RL11); 2. photograph shore communities at locations around the island to provide a basis for future assessment of gross change and to provide illustrative material for lectures and displays (Management Plan Project RL05, RL09, RL10); 3. record in an accurate and repeatable manner, communities and species of high conservation importance (Management Plan Project RF/RA); 4. photograph species present on shores to provide illustrations for lectures and displays (Management Plan Project RL10); and 5. assess the suitability of selected shores for interpretative purposes and collect information for leaflets (Management Plan Project MD 01). Shores were studied and described at the Devil's Kitchen, the Landing Bay from the northern seawall to Surf Point, north of Gannet's Rock and south of Lametry. A circumnavigation of the island provided a general assessment of the shores all around Lundy and photographs for illustrative and monitoring purposes. Detailed monitoring studies were started of rockpools at the Devil's Kitchen, of populations of cup corals at the Devil's Kitchen and north of Gannet's Rock, of the algae Bifurcaria bifurcata, and of a cave community at Rat Island. A general assessment was made of the suitability of Lundy shores for interpretative purposes. The work was designed so that a warden or liason officer could undertake future monitoring. Other areas identified as worthy of monitoring include sandy rock areas below the jetty in the Landing Bay and the large pool between Rat Island and Surf Point.",
