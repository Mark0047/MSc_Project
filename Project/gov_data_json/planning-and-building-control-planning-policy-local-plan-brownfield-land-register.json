        "notes": "This is the Brownfield Land Register of the London Borough of Waltham Forest.\r\n \r\nIn April 2017 regulations were introduced which place a responsibility onto local planning authorities to prepare and maintain a register of brownfield sites. The Register must be published by the 31st of December 2017, and updated annually.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Register is to provide publicly available information on previously developed land (as defined in Annex 2 of the National Planning Policy Framework) throughout the Borough, London, and the country more widely, which offers potential for residential development. This will provide certainty for local authorities, developers and communities, and encourage investment on brownfield land.\r\n\r\nFor a site to be included on the register it must have an area of at least 0.25 hectares, or be capable of providing at least five homes; and residential development on the site must be \u201csuitable\u201d, \u201cavailable\u201d\u2019, and \u201cachievable\u201d. \u201cAchievable\u201d\u2019 in this context means that in the opinion of the local planning authority, development is likely to take place within 15 years of the entry date. The criteria are fully set out in the Brownfield Land Register Regulations 2017.     \r\n\r\nThere are two parts to the Register.\r\n\r\nPart 1 comprises all brownfield sites that the local planning authority has assessed as appropriate for residential development, including sites both with, and without planning permission.\r\n\r\nPart 2 of the Register is a subset of Part 1. Part 2 comprises only those sites in Part 1 that the local planning authority has decided that the land would be suitable for a grant of permission in principle (PiP) for residential development.\r\n\r\nAt this stage the Council has not granted \u2018permission in principle\u2019 for any sites. Accordingly, the Register relates to Part 1 only.",
