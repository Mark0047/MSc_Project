This will generally include the deceased\u2019s marital status, maiden name, and date & place of birth. \r\n\r\nFrom June/July 2013, we will be updating our electronic records with any genealogical information held on archived paper records, and will be updating the most recent Estates on the list first. \r\n\r\nAs of 1 July 2013 the list of historic unclaimed estates will be amalgamated into the current list of advertised estates.   Newly advertised estates will appear daily at the top of the list.  As the list is updated the estates that appeared the day before will be transferred into the alphabetical list.   Any estates where the Treasury Solicitor no longer has an interest, e.g. where  a claim to the estate has been admitted, will be removed daily.  The case reference for each estate has now been added to the list and should be used in correspondence.\r\n\r\nPlease note: The list cannot be guaranteed to be complete and correct and no warranties are given or implied to that effect; the Treasury Solicitor does not accept any responsibility for any loss whatsoever which might result from reliance thereon.",
