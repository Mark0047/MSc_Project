The work was undertaken as part of the contract for Archaeological Services in Relation to the Protection of Wrecks Act (1973). Wessex Archaeology survey operations took place between 2nd and 6th August 2004. All surveying took place off the survey vessel owned and operated by St Andrews University. This is Crown Copyright Data collected and processed by Wessex Archaeology. The geophysical survey included the use of sidescan sonar and sub bottom profiler. The geology and geophysics component of the data are archived at British Geological Survey (BGS) MEDIN Data Archive Centre (DAC) for Geology and Geophysics. Data were also provided to other archive centres as appropriate.",
