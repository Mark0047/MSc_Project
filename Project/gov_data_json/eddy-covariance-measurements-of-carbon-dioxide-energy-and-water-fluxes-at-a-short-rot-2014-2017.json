Turbulent flux densities were monitored using the micrometeorological eddy covariance (EC) technique between 9 January 2014 and 26 November 2017. The dataset includes ancillary weather and soil physics observations, as well as variables describing atmospheric turbulence and the quality of the turbulent flux observations. ",
