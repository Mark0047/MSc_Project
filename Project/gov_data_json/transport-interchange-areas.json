Tackling increasing traffic by controlling street parking and promoting other forms of transports such as public transport, cycling and walking is just one of the many ways in which the council is trying to achieve its goal. The council has also identified a number of key themes it needs to achieve in order to provide residents and visitors to the borough with a climate friendly transport system.",
