They cover new General Needs lettings, at social rent levels, owned by Private Registered Providers (PRPs). All figures are unweighted and are therefore not fully consistent with the weighted social rent data at national level in the 'Social Housing Lettings in England' statistical release.\r\n\r\nData are given for the mean number of days that a property was vacant for prior to a new general needs social rent PRP letting. The time vacant is defined as the period between the void (or new build handover) date or major repairs completion date (if major repairs carried out during the void period) and the tenancy start date.\r\n",
