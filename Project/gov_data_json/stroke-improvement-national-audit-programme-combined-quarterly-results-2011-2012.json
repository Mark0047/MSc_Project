        "notes": "Data submission for SINAP has now ended. The new stroke audit, the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP), is now the single source of stroke data nationally.  SSNAP collects a minimum dataset for every stroke patient since December 2012. For more information, please go to www.strokeaudit.org \r\n\r\nThe Stroke Improvement National Audit Programme (SINAP) was a national  clinical audit which collected information from hospitals in England about the first 72 hours of acute stroke care. \r\n\r\nSINAP aimed to improve the quality of stroke care for patients by measuring hospital performance against evidence based standards of acute care and benchmarking against all hospitals submitting a minimum number of complete records.   Prospective, self-reported data were collected via a web based tool between May 2010 and December 2012 and analysed at the Royal College of Physicians (RCP), London.\r\n\r\nSINAP results for 7 quarters from April 2011 to December 2012 were made public by named hospital.   These results, which can be downloaded below, present national and hospital level data showing performance against important aspects of acute stroke care including 12 key stroke indicators.  The 12 key indicators were selected by the Intercollegiate Stroke Working Party (ICSWP) following analysis of the first year\u2019s data and are considered to be representative of the first 72 hours of care.   Using the same indicators for each quarterly report enabled comparisons over time to be illustrated.    The evidence base behind these Key Indicators can be found in appendix 2 of the PDF version of the report.    The total number of records and the number of records per hospital submitted in each quarter is also included in the table to give context to each hospital's results.\r\n\r\nThe column headings in the table have been abbreviated; please find the list of abbreviated column headings and their corresponding descriptions in Sheet 2 of the spreadsheet.   Please also refer to the guidance for interpreting SINAP results, also in Sheet 2.  \r\n\r\nOnly hospitals which directly admit acute stroke patients were eligible to participate in SINAP.  68% of eligible hospitals in England were included in the final quarterly report.   Non participating hospitals are named in the report.  \r\n\r\nSINAP was run by the RCP Stroke programme on behalf of the Intercollegiate Stroke Working Party (ICSWP) and commissioned by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP).",
