        "notes": "This spatial dataset contains digital boundaries of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) in Wales. The EC Habitats and Species Directive came into effect in 1992 with the aim of maintaining a rich variety of wildlife by protecting vulnerable habitats, and the plants and animals they support. The Habitat Directive together with the 1979 Birds Directive will lead to the establishment of a series of sites throughout Europe that will be known as 'Natura 2000'. This represents the cream of European sites and will ensure their survival for future generations. SACs have been designated over a number of years, from 1993 to the present day, and are on-going.  These sites have been mapped on paper since the mid 1990s and then there was a major review from 2000 with the 'SAC Mode\nration Project' when the data was captured digitally for the first time.",
