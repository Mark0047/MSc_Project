        "notes": "In March 2010, the Scottish CCS (Carbon Capture & Storage) Consortium began an extensive Front End, Engineering and Design (FEED) study to assess what would be required from an engineering, commercial and regulatory, perspective in order to progress the CCS demonstration project at Longannet Power station in Scotland through to construction. The study yielded invaluable knowledge and the resulting material are available for download here. This section of the report is provided as a support document to the tangible learning and documentation contained within the FEED Close Out Report and accompanying appendices. The experiential learning of the teams working across key functions of the FEED study was captured in guided discussions halfway through FEED to establish the specific challenges, successes and learning of the various workstreams involved in undertaking FEED. Representatives from all the workstreams were brought together in December 2010 for a Consortium-wide Lessons Learned Workshop to capture specific, discrete lessons that could benefit future CCS FEED studies in the UK and abroad. Five key themes emerged consistently across workstreams: Ensuring an appropriate mobilisation period Early engagement with key stakeholders Cross-Consortium communication to present an integrated Consortium Recognising restrictions imposed by the bounds of a competitive procurement Working with uncertainty across regulation, scope, budget and political will Workstream specific learning outcomes are summarised in the main report, with detailed examples included in the appendices. The technical and communication workstream appendices both contain examples of actual documents used during the ScottishPower Consortium FEED (National Grid CCS staff training material and the ScottishPower Consortium Communications Strategy) that were considered useful for future CCS project Developers. The appropriate summary section from the Feed Close Out Report can be downloaded as a PDF below (Lessons learned.pdf). The main text of the FEED Close Out Report, together with the supporting appendix for this section can be downloaded as PDF files.
