The purpose of the audit is to review the quality of lung cancer care, to highlight areas for improvement and to reduce variation in practice.\r\n\r\nDue to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring/summer 2020, the outlier policy for this report was amended in line with NHS-wide changes to reduce burden on frontline clinical teams. The outlier process has now been completed and outlier information has been added to version 2 of the report. ",
