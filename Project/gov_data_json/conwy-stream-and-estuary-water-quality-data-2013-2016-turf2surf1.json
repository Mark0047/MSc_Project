        "notes": "The data comprise water quality measurements taken from streams and rivers in the Conwy catchment and its estuary from March 2013 to October 2016. Depending on water type and sampling location the data consist of concentrations of major cations and anions, pH, conductivity, alkalinity, suspended material and coliforms. Samples were collected manually or by automatic sampler. Analysis was carried out at the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) Bangor, CEH Lancaster and Bangor University laboratories. The data were collected provide information on the relationship between stream water quality, primarily macronutrient concentrations, and catchment and hydrological characteristics. The data are used to drive a catchment scale water quality model, and to investigate nutrient ratios and limitation with respect to land cover and management. All sampling and analysis was carried out by trained members of staff from the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology and Bangor University. This data was assembled under the NERC project 'The Multi-Scale Response of Water quality, Biodiversity and Carbon Sequestration to Coupled Macronutrient Cycling from Source to Sea' (Turf2Surf).
