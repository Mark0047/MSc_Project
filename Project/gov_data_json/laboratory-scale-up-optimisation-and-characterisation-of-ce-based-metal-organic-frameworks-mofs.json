        "notes": "Provided here are the experimental data for the synthesis and characterisation of crystallinity and CO2 capture performance of Ce-based metal-organic frameworks. For more details on this material, please find the information in the following open-access paper: 10.26434/chemrxiv.13252544.v2. The project took place at Swansea University, Bay Campus, in the Energy Safety Research institute from 1st October until the 31st December 2021. The material was characterised using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) to ensure crystallinity and CO2 sorption analysis for comparison of CO2 capture performance with the pristine material\u2019s performance. This material showed promising CO2 capture in previous experiments and is of interest to researchers working on the development of porous materials. All data collected during the project is provided.
