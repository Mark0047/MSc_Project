        "notes": "Between 2005 and 2012, 61 marinas and harbours around the English coast were surveyed to record the occurrence of non-native species (NNS) of sessile invertebrates. From these surveys, geographic distributions are described for eight species of ascidians, six bryozoans and five other species. A mean of 6.7 sessile invertebrate NNS per site (range 0 to 13 species) was recorded. At the 43 sites on the English Channel coast, the mean was 7.8 NNS per site, and all of the ten English sites that had 10 NNS were in the western or central region of the Channel coast. Ten sites on the Channel coast surveyed in 2004 were re-visited at least once in 2009 or 2010, and the mean number of sessile invertebrate NNS had increased from 6.0 to 7.6 species per site. Combining data from all visits in 2005 to 2012 for the sites surveyed in 2004, the mean number of NNS recorded per site rose to 9.2. Very rapid rates of spread along the English coast and beyond are inferred for the erect bryozoan Tricellaria inopinata d'Hondt and Occhipinti Ambrogi, 1985 and the ascidian Corella eumyota Traustedt, 1882. At least five recently arrived species that were limited to a small number of sites in 2012 are expected to increase markedly in geographic range and prevalence: the ascidians Asterocarpa humilis (Heller, 1878), Botrylloides diegensis Ritter and Forsyth, 1917, and Didemnum vexillum Kott, 2002; and the bryozoans Schizoporella japonica Ortmann, 1890 and Watersipora subatra (Ortmann, 1890). Rapid assessment surveys of marinas and similar sites proved to be an effective means of documenting the arrival and spread of NNS over a relatively wide geographic range and of distinguishing different rates of progression.",
