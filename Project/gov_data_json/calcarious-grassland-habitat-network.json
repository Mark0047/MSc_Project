        "notes": "In 2020, with generous funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, Ulster Wildlife, National Trust NI, RSPB NI and Woodland Trust NI came together to start building capacity to deliver Nature Recovery Networks in Northern Ireland. As part of the project, habitat networks maps were produced for all terrestrial and intertidal priority habitats, based on the Natural England (Edwards et al., 2020) methodology. The habitat networks comprise vector datasets that map areas of land into different network categories, based on how favourable the land is for restoration to priority habitat, and how effective restoration in each area would be at enhancing connectivity of the priority habitat, based on proximity to existing habitat patches. A description of these network categories is provided in Table 1 in the methodology report, available at https://www.ulsterwildlife.org/sites/default/files/2022-10/EnvSys%20NI%20NRN%20mapping%20report.pdf.\r\n\r\nThe habitat network maps do not represent a fully comprehensive depiction of land cover, nor do they provide specific land management options and do not therefore replace the need for an on-site ecological surveys/appraisals. The maps are intended to function as a decision-support tool alongside other pieces of information, both from on-site surveys and data from other sources.",

Digital NI aims to help establish a culture within Northern Ireland that develops and enhances Digital capability not just through interactions with Government, but also with local companies and throughout communities. Within government the Digital Transformation Service is facilitating this cultural shift through a number of methods, transforming Government services, making data open and available and encouraging and coaching those who lack digital skills.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that opening up our data is the right thing to do in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the Public Sector in Northern Ireland. It has the potential to encourage new commercial opportunities and drive economic growth and innovation across public and private sectors.",
