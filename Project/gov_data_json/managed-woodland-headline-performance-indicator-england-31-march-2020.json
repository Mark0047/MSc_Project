It is recognised that there are other woodlands that could be considered to be 'managed'.\n\n1) Any English Woodland Grant Scheme (EWGS) Woodland Creation Grant (WCG) whose first instalment payment date was < 15 years ago at the end of the reporting period.\n\n2) Any English Woodland Grant Scheme (EWGS) Woodland Management Grant (WMG) whose first instalment payment date was < 15 years ago at the end of the reporting period.\n\n3) Any English Woodland Grant Scheme (EWGS) Woodland Planning Grant (WPG)\nwhose first instalment payment date was < 15 years ago at the end of the reporting\nperiod.\n4) Any English Woodland Grant Scheme (EWGS) Woodland Improvement Grant (WIG) whose first instalment payment date was < 15 years ago at the end of the reporting period.\n\n5) Any Farm Woodland Premium Scheme (FWPS) and Farm Woodland Premium (FWPS) whose scheme approval date was <15 years ago at the end of the reporting period.\n\n6) Any Woodland Grants Scheme Mk3 (WGS3) schemes that have been in contract in the 15 years up until the end of the reporting period.\n\n7) Any Felling Licence Applications (FLA) whose registration date was <15 years ago at the end of the reporting period.\n\n8) All Public Forest Estate land owned and/or managed by the Forestry Commission at the end of the reporting period.\n\n9) All woodland managed by the Defence Infrastructure Organisation department of the MOD classified as a Training Area.\n\n10) Any Countryside Stewardship Woodland Creation agreement whose first payment date was < 15 years ago at the end of the reporting period.\n\nEXCLUDED: EWGS Woodland Assessment Grant (WAG), EWGS Woodland Regeneration Grant (WRG), Forest Plans, Dedication, WGS2, WGS1 and Natural England\u2019s HLS.\n\nThe 'denominator' used for calculation of the indicator, i.e. the figure used as the entire woodland area in England, was that obtained from the most recent version of the National Forest Inventory (NFI) at the time of computation.\n\nThe administrative data sources are integrated to produce a single layer indicating woodland management status and this is provided as a File Geodatabase Raster.\nCell values: 1 = Unmanaged woodland, 2 = Actively managed woodland.
