        "notes": "This spreadsheet contains the most up to date version of boundaries of inshore and offshore SACs with marine components, including sites that straddle the inshore/offshore (territorial seas) boundary. Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) with marine components are defined on the basis of the presence of Habitats Directive Annex I habitat and/or Annex II species interest features that are associated with the marine environment. A list of these features can be found here http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-4166 and the definition of SACs with marine components is set out in the following paper:  http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/pdf/MN2KPG16_13_MN2KDefs.pdf \n\u00c2\u00a0\nThe Annex I \u00e2\u0080\u009cmarine\u00e2\u0080\u009d habitats were classified according to the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &c.) Regulations 1994 in which \u00e2\u0080\u009cmarine areas\u00e2\u0080\u009d are defined as those areas of land covered (continuously or intermittently) by tidal waters, or any part of the sea. The Annex II \u00e2\u0080\u009cmarine\u00e2\u0080\u009d species were defined as those dependent on the marine environment for all or part of their lifecycle.  Some species and habitats may only be associated with the marine environment under certain circumstances and in certain sites \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this is described in more detail below.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nOne or more of these marine habitats/species must be present as a qualifying feature (see below) within the SAC for it to be defined as a SAC with marine components. Some coastal SACs may not contain any marine habitats/species and so these are not included here. Other coastal SACs may contain a mixture of marine and non-marine features \u00e2\u0080\u0093 only the marine features are listed in this spreadsheet but the Non-marine interest features column on the SAC Sites worksheet indicates where additional non-marine features are protected in that site.\n\nData covers: Site code, Site name, Site status, Country, CP2 Region, Feature type, Qualifying marine interest features and Lay title or common name.\n\nThis dataset is supported by a shapefile available at: http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/ProtectedSites/SACselection/gis_data/terms_conditions.asp",
