It is an entitlement to a 25% reduction in rates for any household where both the following criteria are met:\t\t\t\r\n- a person with a disability lives; and\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n- where the property has been adapted or has additional facilities added.\r\nThe property must be adapted to meet the needs of a person with a disability who lives in the home. The types of adaptations that qualify are:\r\n- A room, other than a kitchen, bathroom or toilet, which is mainly used by the person with a disability for treatment or therapy.\t\t\t\t\r\n- An extra kitchen for the person with a disability.\t\t\t\t\t\r\n- An extra toilet for the person with a disability.\t\t\t\t\t\r\n- An extra bathroom.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n- Sufficient floor space to use a wheelchair easily.\r\nThe information provided is at a point in time and the tables are updated annually.",

Digital NI aims to help establish a culture within Northern Ireland that develops and enhances Digital capability not just through interactions with Government, but also with local companies and throughout communities. Within government the Digital Transformation Service is facilitating this cultural shift through a number of methods, transforming Government services, making data open and available and encouraging and coaching those who lack digital skills.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that opening up our data is the right thing to do in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the Public Sector in Northern Ireland. It has the potential to encourage new commercial opportunities and drive economic growth and innovation across public and private sectors.",
