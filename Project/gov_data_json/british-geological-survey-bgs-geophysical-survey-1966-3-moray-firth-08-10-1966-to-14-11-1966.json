        "notes": "This marine geophysical survey was carried out by Hunting Geology and Geophysics Ltd for Institute of Geological Sciences now British Geological Survey (BGS), the survey took place from October to November 1966 in the Moray Firth on board the MV Rosherville. The purpose was to collect data for regional marine survey linking the coastal geology with offshore structures, test equipment and techniques and train personnel. This project constituted the initial steps of the Institute of Geological Sciences (now BGS) regional marine survey of eastern Scottish waters. At the end of the geophysical survey two days of sampling equipment trials were undertaken. Sea floor data were collected using echosounder. Sub-surface data were collected using boomer; proton magnetometer. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in IGS report 70/1.",
