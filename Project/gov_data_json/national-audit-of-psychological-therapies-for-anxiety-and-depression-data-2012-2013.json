        "notes": "The dataset comprises the data submitted for the second round of the National Audit of Psychological Therapies for Anxiety and Depression (NAPT) during the period July 2012 \u2013 January 2013. This includes a retrospective case record audit, a therapist questionnaire and a service user questionnaire.\r\nThe audit was open to all NHS-funded psychological therapy services in England and Wales providing therapy in the community for adults with anxiety and depression. The 220 services that participated constituted a wide range of psychological therapy services, including primary and secondary care, IAPT and non-IAPT, NHS managed, private or voluntary sector managed, and of varied size. (IAPT services are those that have been set up under the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme). \r\nThe data show performance against the ten audit standards, which map onto four areas of quality: access, appropriateness, acceptability and outcomes. Only English data are presented in this dataset, which includes data from the 220 services which submitted a total of 122,812 case records, 4,661 therapist questionnaires, and 14,587 service user questionnaires.\r\nFor each audit standard, where services had fewer than 30 eligible cases, it has been indicated that the number of cases is so small that the data are not presented for reasons of reliability.\r\n",
