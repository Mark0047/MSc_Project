        "notes": "This dataset shows net additional dwellings by local authority district, England 2004-05 to 2014-15. All figures have been rounded to the nearest 10. 0 represents 0-4, the dwelling counts from the 2011 Census have been used to revise the net supply estimates from 2004-05 to 2010-11. The 2011/12 to 2014/15 figures are provisional and subject to scheduled revisions pending the release of future census dwelling stock data.\r\n\r\n\n\nNet additions measures the absolute change in dwelling stock between 1 April and 31 March of the following year. The absolute change in the dwelling stock is the number of new house building completions plus any gains or losses through conversions, demolitions and changes of use (also referred to as Net supply of housing). \r\n\r\nSources \r\n\r\nHousing Flows Reconciliation (HFR), the Greater London Authority and Regional Assembly joint returns. From 2000-01 to 2003-04, all local authorities submitted data to CLG through the Housing Flows Reconciliation (HFR) form. Following the abolition of the Regional Planning Bodies in 2010, local authorities in all regions except London have returned to submitting data via the HFR from 2009-10.  \r\nData for London are supplied by the GLA.\r\nBetween 2004-05 and 2008-09 CLG worked jointly with Regional Planning bodies in the south and midlands on joint data returns in an attempt to ensure consistency between the net housing supply figures reported in regional Annual Monitoring Reports (AMRs) and those published by central government.\r\n\r\nThis data was derived from Table 122, available for download as an [Excel spreadsheet](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/373396/LiveTable_122.ods).
