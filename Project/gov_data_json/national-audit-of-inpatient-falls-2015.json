        "notes": "Inpatient falls are common and remain a great challenge for the NHS. Falls in hospital are the most\r\ncommonly reported patient safety incidents, with more than 240,000 reported in acute hospitals and\r\nmental health trusts in England and Wales every year (that is over 600 a day). All falls, even those that\r\ndo not result in injury, can cause older patients and their family to feel anxious and distressed. For those\r\nwho are frail, minor injuries from a fall can affect their physical function, resulting in reduced mobility,\r\nand undermining their confidence and independence. Some falls in hospital result in serious injuries,\r\nsuch as hip fracture (more than 3,000 per year) and serious head injuries, and these injuries can result in\r\ndeath. Falls in hospitals are financially expensive, as they increase the length of stay and may require\r\nincreased care costs upon discharge. In 2007, inpatient falls were thought to cost trusts alone \u00a315\r\nmillion, and will be more expensive now.\r\n\r\nTackling the problem of inpatient falls is challenging. There are no single or easily defined interventions\r\nwhich, when done on their own, are shown to reduce falls. However, research has shown that multiple\r\ninterventions performed by the multidisciplinary team and tailored to the individual patient can reduce\r\nfalls by 20\u201330%. These interventions are particularly important for patients with dementia or delirium,\r\nwho are at high risk of falls in hospitals. ",

HQIP is an independent organisation led by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, The Royal College of Nursing, and National Voices and it works in partnership with patients and healthcare professionals to influence and improve healthcare practice at all levels. \r\n\r\nHQIP commissions, manages, supports, and promotes national and local programmes of quality improvement. This includes the national clinical audit programmes, the Clinical Outcome Review Programmes and the National Joint Registry on behalf of NHS England and other healthcare departments and organisations.  \r\n\r\nIn compliance with its commissioning status, HQIP:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Uses best management and procurement practice to ensure robust results and actionable recommendations.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Ensures patients and carers remain at the heart of its work through continued, strategic involvement in all relevant processes and projects.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Supports professionals to review and improve their practice by providing education and training programmes, and opportunities to share best practice as part of promoting an integrated approach to quality improvement.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Works to inform and influence national healthcare policy by effectively communicating its work and that of its partners.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Encourages wide use of robust data for quality improvement of care, offering patient choice, promoting patient safety, supporting revalidation and service accreditation, commissioning, service redesign, and research.\r\n\r\nFurther information about the HQIP Board, the team, and the organisations that HQIP work with is available on the HQIP website at http://www.hqip.org.uk/about-us/.",
