        "notes": "This data describes the recovering and isolation processes of Bacteroides spp. strains from human and cattle faecal sources from rural areas in Siaya County (Kenya), and occurred between 7th and 28th of June 2018. The data also includes the detection of bacteriophages (infecting these Bacteroides spp. host strains) in conjunction with traditional faecal indicator organisms in water sources from Kisumu and Siaya County (Kenya) occurring between June 18th 2018 and June 13th 2019. Exact location (coordinates) of the sample points are also described in the data set. A microbiological technique using Bile Esculin Bacteroides (BBE) agar was used for the recovering and isolation processes of Bacteroides spp. strains. Standard ISO (7899-2, 9308-1, 10705-2 and 10705-4) techniques, such as membrane filtration and the double-agar-layer methods, were used for the detection of bacteriophages and traditional faecal indicator organisms. The purpose of data collection was to develop new markers that could identify cattle and/or human sources of faecal contamination, which could be used as part of a Microbial Source Tracking (MST) tool box. Technicians and researchers from the University of Brighton (UK), University of Southampton (UK), from the Victoria Institute for Research on Environment and Development (VIRED) (KE) and from the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) (KE) were responsible for the collection and interpretation of data.
