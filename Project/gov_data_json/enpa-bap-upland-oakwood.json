        "notes": "The steep-sided combes and coastal slopes of Exmoor still support large expanses of ancient woodland. These are largely of the upland oak woodland type, which on Exmoor is easily defined by the predominance in the canopy of sessile oak. Other trees and shrubs are much scarcer, though downy birth is usually present, and holly, rowan and hazel tend to be present in the understorey. In NVC terms, this is defined as the W17 sessile oak \u2013 downy birth \u2013 Dicranum majus moss community. In addition, richer soils on flatter ground and in the valley bottoms and around spring lines support woodland in which pedunculate oak and ash may be locally dominant. Though much smaller in area, these communities form an important part of the upland oak wood complex and are particularly important for the communities of rare lichens they support.\n\nSome of Exmoor\u2019s upland oakwoods contain areas of wood pasture with numerous ancient pollards. The management issues in such areas are rather different to those pertaining to the woodlands proper and they are dealt with under the \u201cparklands, wood pastures and veteran trees\u201d HAP.\n\nSome of Exmoor\u2019s upland oakwoods contain areas of wood pasture with numerous ancient pollards.
