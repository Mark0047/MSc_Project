        "notes": "This Gardline marine geophysical survey took place during June/July 2007 along the south coast of England around the Isle of Wight aboard the MV Confidante. This survey was undertaken for the South Coast Regional Environmental Characterisation (REC). This study was funded by the Marine Environment Protection Fund (MEPF) a marine component of the Aggregate Levy Sustainability Fund (MALSF). The study was conducted in two parts, with this survey covering the geophysical data. Sea floor data collected were\u00a0high-resolution multibeam bathymetry, backscatter, magnetometer and side-scan sonar. Subsurface data were gathered using a Surface Tow Boomer. Most of the data were recorded digitally. These data are archived with the MEDIN Data Archive Centres (DACs), including the BGS DAC for geology and geophysics. Technical details of the survey are contained in Gardline Report 7261.",
