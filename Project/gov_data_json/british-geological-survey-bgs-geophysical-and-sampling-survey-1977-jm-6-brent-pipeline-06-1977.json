Seabed samples and cores were collected using Shipek grab, Gravity corer and cone dredge. Seafloor data was collected using Transit Sonar (MS47). Subsurface seismic data were collected using a Pingerand Sparker. A geochemical eel was also used. Towed seabed Gamma-ray spectometer demonstation - Report by Miller & Roberts. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS Internal Report ??.",
