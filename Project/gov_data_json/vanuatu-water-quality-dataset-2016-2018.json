As part of the Commonwealth Marine Economies \nProgramme, water quality measurements were collected over three years in the \ncoastal waters around the island of Efate, and on one occasion around the \nisland of Tanna. Observations focus on Port Vila (Efate), which is the main \nurbanised area on the Island. Key water quality parameters are presented \n(salinity, temperature, turbidity and total suspended solids, light \nattenuation, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll and phaeophytin, and nutrients) \nwhich represent part of a larger research program on water quality, human \nhealth and habitat mapping.",
