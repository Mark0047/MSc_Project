        "notes": "National Audit of Inpatient Falls Data from March 2020 facilities audit, reported on in Interim Annual Report, published May 2021. \r\n\r\nFalls are the most frequently reported incident affecting hospital inpatients, with 247,000 falls occurring in inpatient settings each year in England alone (NHS Improvement). The data collected by NAIF and presented below provide  opportunity to identify areas in which to enhance the quality of care for people who sustain an inpatient hip fracture.\r\n\r\nIn April 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, submission of audit data was\r\nmade non-mandatory. To help organisations catch up with data inputting, NAIF extended the clinical audit deadline to the end of 2020. This means that\r\ninstead of publishing a single report combining clinical and facilities data,\r\nthis interim report describes facilities data (facilities audit open March to August 2020) and further analysis of inpatient hip fractures from the National Hip Fracture Database. Clinical data will be published in a separate report in Autumn 2021. ",
