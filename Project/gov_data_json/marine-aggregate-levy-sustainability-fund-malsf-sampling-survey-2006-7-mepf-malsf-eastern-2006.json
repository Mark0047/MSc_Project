        "notes": "This CEFAS sampling survey took place during July/August 2006 in the Eastern English Channel aboard the RV CEFAS Endeavour. This survey was undertaken for the Eastern English Channel Marine Habitat Map study (EECMHM) as part of a series of four surveys. The EECMHM study was funded by the Marine Environment Protection Fund (MEPF) a marine component of the Aggregate Levy Sustainability Fund (MALSF). Samples were collected using a HamCam (Hamon grab with camera fitted), Camera Sledge and Beam Trawl. These data are archived with the MEDIN Data Archive Centres (DACs) including the BGS DAC for geology and geophysics and the DASSH DAC for biological data. Where hardcopy records/samples exist these have been archived by CEFAS. For further information on the surveys and general information on the EECMHM see the final report (James et al, 2007. Cefas Science Series Technical Report No. 139).",
