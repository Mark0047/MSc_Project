        "notes": "This dataset contains the acquired distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) and hydrophone datasets from a project investigating the usage DAS at the UK Geoenergy Observatory (UKGEOS) research facility in Glasgow, funded by the UK Unconventional Hydrocarbons (UKUH) small project grant. The UKGEOS site in Glasgow has repurposed an abandoned coal mine to investigate its potential as a heat source and heat sink, and its borehole infrastructure includes pre-installed fibre-optic cables. DAS is a novel seismic monitoring technique that utilizes fibre-optic cables to measure small acoustic and seismic vibrations. Comparable to a very densely spaced hydrophone or geophone array, DAS provides unparalleled data resolution and insights into the subsurface. This dataset provides both active source and passive measurements of DAS at the UKGEOS Site 2 prior to the heat pump installation, providing geophysical baseline measurements of the mine. Alongside the acquired DAS data, data from a hydrophone array co-located to the fibre-optic cable was collected during the active source survey to provide a means of comparison to the DAS. NERC and ESRC jointly funded Unconventional Hydrocarbons in the UK Energy System Programme grant - Baseline seismic monitoring survey for UKGEOS Glasgow geothermal production using Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS)",
