        "notes": "This data set describes the seed dispersal process of both invaded (presence of Linepithema humile) and non-invaded (absence of L. humile) ant communities. Data were collected from four field sites in and around Girona (41.9794\u00b0 N, 2.8214\u00b0 E), Northern Spain, during the summer months of 2014 (June-July) and 2015 (July-September). Experiment 1: Ant community structure of both invaded and non-invaded ant communities was determined using a series of pitfall and baiting traps. Experiment 2: Ant communities were presented with seeds (from eight plant species) via a cafeteria setup and the rate of removal was measured over 24 hours. Experiment 3: A series of 30.25 m2 grids were setup to determine the density (number of nests and number of foraging trails) of both invasive L. humile and native Pheidole pallidula ant species. Experiment 4: Seeds were presented to nests of both the invasive L. humile and native P. pallidula ant species, after 72 hours nests were excavated and the seeds were retrieved. Data was collected from all four experiments to test hypothesis about the dispersal ability of the dominant seed dispersing ant species in both invaded and non-invaded ant communities. Funding was received from a NERC-Case studentship (NE/K007076/1) and COST Action TD1209 (ECOST-STSM-TD1209: 070915-062123, 010715-062122, and 160614-046307) grant. Data provided in its raw format.
