The earliest records discovered date back \nto surveys undertaken in 1904. For the period up to 1970, when reliable \ncomputer databases began, records of 2,367 surveys by 12 sea-going research \nvessels and eight estaurine/inshore vessels were located. A description of the \ntype of data that were held in each of the 2,475 scientists Log Books from \nthese surveys is included in a fully searchable Catalogue. A continuous record \nof research vessel activity is available, except for the periods during World \nWars I and II. All data are now catalogued and stored in secure modern \narchiving facilities, and the CEFAS Library is the custodian of this data.",
