Authorities should report the level they have reached as follows: Level 0: LA has not assessed and managed climate risks and opportunities, or incorporated appropriate action into local authority strategic planning. Level 1: LA has undertaken a comprehensive, local risk-based assessment of current vulnerabilities to weather and climate. Level 2. LA has identified effective adaptation responses to address the risks and opportunities, explicitly related to other council strategies, plans and operations. Level 3. LA has developed an adaptation action plan to deliver steps to achieve the existing objectives, and partnership arrangements in light of projected climate change. Level 4. LA has implemented an adaptation action plan and a process for monitoring and review to ensure progress with each measure.\n\nSource: Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)\n\nPublisher: DCLG Floor Targets Interactive\n\nGeographies: County/Unitary Authority, Government Office Region (GOR), National\n\nGeographic coverage: England\n\nTime coverage: 2008/09",
