The growth in Barnet\u2019s population will change our existing communities, attracting a younger and more diverse population, in addition to this, the increase in population will have a significant impact on the way people travel, which is why Barnet is planning to implement a strategy to manage this and make journeys for these people easier.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe strategy will outline the Council\u2019s commitment to improving transport options for all of our residents. This will involve considering what our appropriate \u201cmix\u201d of future travel modes should be and how we should be investing in various travel modes in order to arrive at a comprehensive choice of travel options for residents that effectively integrate with one another.
