Opinions are sought over a range of service areas to gain an understanding of service users' views rather than measuring quantities of care delivered. \r\n\r\nThis particular survey is targeted at service users aged 18 and over receiving community equipment or a minor adaptation funded wholly or in part by Social Services, and aims to learn more about whether or not the community equipment or minor adaptation is helping them to live safely and independently in their own home. \r\n",
