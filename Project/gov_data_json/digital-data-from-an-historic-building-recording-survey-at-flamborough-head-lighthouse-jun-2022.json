        "notes": "This digital archive contains a report, images and a mp4 video from an analytic historic building recording survey (Level 3) at Flamborough Head Lighthouse, Flamborough, East Riding of Yorkshire. The recording was undertaken by York Archaeology between 1 June - 22 June 2022.\n     The recording was undertaken to provide a permanent record of the current Fresnel Lens optic of the lighthouse, which is to be replaced with a modern light. The 1925 optic will be moved to the basement of the tower and installed as part of the museum display. The recording comprised drawn plans, elevations, sections and a detailed drawing of the optic, a general photographic record of the lighthouse and detailed 360-degree photographic record of the optic lens, the capturing of a video recording the operation of the light mechanism at night, written notes, and the production of an illustrated report. The historic building recording, together with the previous research, successfully identified evidence of different phases of construction and mechanisation. Flamborough Head Lighthouse was built in 1806 when it was lit by an oil burner. In the early 1870s the oil burner was replaced by a paraffin light source, and a new two-storey accommodation block was built at the base of the tower to replace a smaller range. This development included a new lantern, new dioptric apparatus, new dwellings and alterations to the tower designed by J M Douglas. The current Fresnel lens system, rotating on the mercury bath, was installed in 1925. This system has continued to operate to date. The adjoining block provided ancillary operational areas to the lighthouse as well as two keeper's cottages that are currently private residences. The historic building recording has provided an account of the developmental history of Flamborough Head Lighthouse and a permanent record of the existing optic lens that is deemed to be appropriate to the building's significance, as stipulated by the planning condition.",
