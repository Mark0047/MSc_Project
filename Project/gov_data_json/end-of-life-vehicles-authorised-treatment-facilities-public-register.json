        "notes": "The Environment Agency is responsible for ensuring that Authorised Waste Treatment Facilities (ATF) sites in England comply with current legislation. We monitor permitted ATF sites to ensure they are treating End of Life Vehicles (ELVs) correctly. \nUnder ELV legislation, ATF sites must issue the last owner of a motor vehicle (car, light van, or three-wheel) with a Certificate of Destruction after scrapping a vehicle and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) will then remove that vehicle from their registration database. The DVLA and the Department for Business Innovation and Skills are responsible for administering charges for disposal.\nOmission from this register does not necessarily mean that a site does not meet the ELV legislative standards for an ATF. Omission could mean the site operator does want to be on the ATF Register because the site only deals with vehicles that don\u2019t require a Certificate of Destruction, such as motorbikes.\nINFORMATION WARNING:\nOmission from this register does not necessarily mean that a site does not meet the ELV legislative standards for an ATF.
