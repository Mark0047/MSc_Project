The survey was carried out as part of a regional mapping programme. Data were gathered for Project:72/4 using the following equipment Navigation: Decca Hifix and Main Chain; La Coste and Romberg Air-Sea Gravity Meter; Barringer Magnetometer; MS47 Transit Sonar; Edo Western Sub-Bottom Profiler; Sparker, over 8000 km were covered in a grid of 60 lines. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS Internal Report WB/ MG/72/34.",
