The outcomes arising from the assessment will inform the LBB Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) which will underpin the Local Plan. The IDP\u2019s purpose is to set out an analysis and assessment of existing infrastructure provision within Barnet including playing pitches, and identify existing and future needs and demands for the Council to support new development and a changing population to 2031. This provides evidence for the consideration for additional inclusion in the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) or in the application of S106.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe draft has been developed in accordance with Sport England guidelines and with the involvement of the National Governing Bodies of the sports to which it relates: Cricket, Football, Hockey, Rugby Union and Tennis; in addition to Sport England. The draft strategy also takes into account the requirements Gaelic Football in Barnet.\r\nSports clubs and leagues, together with pitch providers based in the Borough were all involved in the development of the draft strategy; ensuring the capture of the views and opinions of the local sports community on the adequacy of provision of playing pitches in Barnet. It is now proposed that the draft PPS will be subject to a wider public consultation process prior to it being formally adopted by the Council.
