        "notes": "This sampling and geophysical survey has been carried out by University of Bergen in collaboration with British Geological Survey (BGS), the survey took place in July 1996 on the North Sea Margin (North Sea Fan; Miller Slide and Faeroe-Shetland Channel) on board the RV Hakon Mosby. The purpose was to collect data as a contribution to the Europen Union\u2019s project \u201cEuropean North Atlantic Margin (ENAM II): Quantification and modelling of large-scale sedimentary processes and fluxes\u201d program. Sea floor data were collected using echo sounder. Sub-bottom profiling data were collected using airgun and deep tow boomer. Sample data were collected using gravity corer. These data are archived by University of Bergen, copy seismic records archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in University of Bergen ENAM II cruise report No. 2 (Non-BGS report reference 2006/9).",
