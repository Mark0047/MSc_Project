ScanFish is a high performance towed undulating CTD which \nwas deployed by Cefas, initially, to aid the understanding of the coupling \nbetween physical and biological processes (Brown et al., 1996). It was towed \nbehind the vessel at approximately 8 knots and undulated from the near surface \n(~4m) to within a few meters (~5m) of the bed, down to water depths of 135m. \nThe vertical ascent rate was controlled so that each undulation covered a \nhorizontal distance of 1km, regardless of water depth.",
