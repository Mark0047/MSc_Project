        "notes": "Report contains data that can be used under Open Government Licence.\n\nThis project aims to develop techniques and a reference data library that will enable verification of the declared origin of imported timbers that are protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild flora and fauna (CITES) The project will combine existing genetic and new isotopic information (e.g. carbon, sulphur and oxygen) into an enhanced tool to determine the provenance of timber. It will use some specially sourced reference samples and build on research done by Kew to determine \u2018 fingerprints\u2019 of tree species and the country of growth using DNA finger printing and population modelling, as well a statistical analysis and it will extend this capability by including the isotopic analysis- which relate to specific conditions where the tree was growing. Outputs include the final report on the success of the techniques as well as the data base and referenced samples that may be used to influence the international community for enhanced controls on CITES timber exports and imports.",
