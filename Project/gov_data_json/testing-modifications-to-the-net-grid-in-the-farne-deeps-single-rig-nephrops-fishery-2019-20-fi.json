        "notes": "This work was carried out as part of the Fisheries Science Partnership (FSP) \nprogramme. The aim of this project was to further develop a selective Net Grid \ntrawl with two cod ends to improve performance and enable skippers to better \nmatch their catch compositions to their quota allocations. The information \nfrom the trials will help skippers adapt to the Landing Obligation by avoiding \nunwanted fish in a fishery identified as having relatively high discard rates \nand will demonstrate to managers the level of selectivity improvement that is \ncurrently achievable to help formulate Discard Plans. The specific objective \nwas to modify the escape area in the Net Grid to retain selected commercial \nspecies and minimise catches of unwanted fish. This was achieved by conducting \nfield trials of a modified Net Grid trawl with two cod ends \u2013 a lower cod end \nto retain primarily the *Nephrops* and an upper cod end to retain and \nselect for commercial fish.\n\nAt each station sampled, shot and haul, positional and times information were \nrecorded, and for all species of fish length distribution data were taken.",
