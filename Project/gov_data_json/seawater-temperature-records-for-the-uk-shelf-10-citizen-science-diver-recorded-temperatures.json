        "notes": "This dataset has been extracted as part of an exercise to assemble \"all\" Cefas \nTemperature Data and publish it in a Data paper. It is one of 17 Cefas data \nsources assembled.\n\nThis data source differs from the others in this collection because it arises \nfrom an investigation into the potential for Citizen Science to contribute to \nassessments of the marine environment. The dataset is derived from a database \ncontaining over 7,000 records of temperature data collected from temperature \ncompensated dive computers. The lowest temperature is recorded from the \nthermal sensor. The unprocessed data were then subjected to a quality control \nprocess that compared the temperature with the relevant sea surface \ntemperature (obtained from OSTIA \u2013 Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea \nIce Analysis \u2013 \n`http://ghrsst\u2013pp.metoffice.com/pages/latest_analysis/ostia.html`_).\n\nThere was a linear correlation between the sea surface temperature and the \nrecorded temperature at depth. Values exceeding a specified difference from \nthe surface temperature (5\u00b0C) were excluded. This resulted in a quality \nassured dataset of just over 5,000 records (including freshwater and lake \ndata). The subset of global dataset provided covers the UK shelf.\n\nThe 5\u00b0C threshold is derived from previous analyses of the performance of dive \ncomputers.\n\n\n\n\n.. _`http://ghrsst\u2013pp.metoffice.com/pages/latest_analysis/ostia.html`:\n    http://ghrsst-pp.metoffice.com/pages/latest_analysis/ostia.html",
