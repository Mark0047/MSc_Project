All data is derived from the patient-level Radiotherapy Treatment Dataset (RTDS) data recorded by National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS).\r\n\u2022 Data is aggregated using anatomical site groups according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) ICD-10 codes, except where otherwise stated. Groupings are identified in tab: \u2018Reference \u2013 tumour groupings.\u2019 Data is further aggregated by age at treatment start date (presented as 5 year age bands) and sex (male/female).\r\n\u2022 Treatments are categorised by modality or method of treatment, as (1) external beam radiotherapy (EBRT or Teletherapy) and (2) internal brachytherapy\r\n\r\nWhenever it is possible and practicable to do so, data released by PHE will be anonymous and made available under an Open Government License. To render the data anonymous it must be stripped of direct identifiers and privacy by design methods applied in line with the rules layed out in the ISB Anonymisation Standard for Publishing Health and Social Care Data Specification (2013).\r\n\r\n",
