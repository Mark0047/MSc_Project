This dataset includes data on the degree of herbivory and infection of the fungal pathogen, Valdensia heterodoxa, on the deciduous shrub Vaccinium myrtillus in the experiment plots at the Climoor field site in the Clocaenog Forest, NE Wales. Herbivory was measured in the summer of 2000, 2005 (control and drought plots only) and 2006. Fungal infection was measured in 2000, 2005 (control and drought plots only) 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. Measurements were taken at the same time as annual vegetative growth and flowering assessment at a time of maximal growth (late August- early September).
