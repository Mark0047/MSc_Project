        "notes": "All paleointensity data gathered from the project at University of Liverpool. The data is divided into multiple four letter coded sections which refer to a specific locality and/or experiment type. The sections are as follows: CFEH - Thermal paleointensity experiment on natural clinkers from Montana, USA, looking primarily at the Epsilon Hematite phase, with an additional high-power alternating field demagnetisation step after each infield step of the experiment. LPRM - volcanic material from Kinghorn and Wormit Bay, Scotland (335 and 410 million years old). This was a specific experiment with samples given a prior high temperature applied field of 80 micro Tesla and a pressure remanent magnetisation of 80 micro Tesla. VFSS \u2013 a microwave paleointensity experiment carried out on Scottish vitrified fort material, sampled in the 1980s. WTBY \u2013 microwave paleointensity experiments carried out on Scottish volcanics from Wormit Bay. Sampled September 2015. YDSR \u2013 volcanics from Yandiniling Dike Swarm, in Yilgarn Craton, Australia, 2.6 billion years old. Sampled Nov 2018. Sampled with Yebo Li from the University of Curtin (Perth) as part of a collaboration, resampling of 16WDS sites from his palaeodirections paper. These were microwave demagnetisation (specimen orientation only) and paleointensities. NERC grant NE/P00170X/1.",
