Information for sites in Wales is included where the site crosses the border into England.  Detailed information on terminology and the WFD process is available in our supporting information on the Catchment Data Explorer website.\nRBDs and Catchments Cycle 2 (AfA295), Lists of the River Basin Districts, 'Management Catchments' and 'Operational Catchments' we divide the country into, for the purposes of integrated catchment management and the WFD.\nWater Bodies Cycle 2 (AfA296), A list of the water bodies that we further sub-divide the country into for the purposes of integrated catchment management and the WFD.\nWater Body Classifications Cycle 2 (AfA297), WFD classifications for water bodies at various levels for various years.\nWater Body Outcomes (AfA298), Our targets for water body classifications at various points in the future.\nInvestigations (AfA430), Details of Investigations that establish if the classification result shows a valid problem within a water body and identify reasons for failure.\nReasons for Failure (AfA318), Reasons for Failure identify the cause of less than good classifications (activity, source, sector). The cause is recorded using a defined set of reasons for failure.\nActions and Measures (AfA096), Descriptions of remedial actions and measures being taken to improve the status of a waterbody and the associated costs.
