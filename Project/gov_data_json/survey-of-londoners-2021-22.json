        "notes": "In 2018-19 the GLA first undertook a [Survey of Londoners](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/survey-of-londoners-headline-findings). At the time it provided vital evidence on Londoners that had never been collected before in such detail.\u00a0\n\nIn 2021-22, the GLA conducted another Survey of Londoners, following the same methodology as the Survey of Londoners 2018-19, an online and paper self-completion survey of adults aged 16 and over in London.\n\nThe survey, which received responses from 8,630 Londoners, aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 and associated restrictions on key social outcomes for Londoners, not available from other data sources.\u00a0\n\nIt is important to understand the context in which the Survey of Londoners 2021-22 took place. Survey fieldwork began in November 2021; so, up to that point, it had been four months since most legal limits on social contact had been removed. However, after fieldwork had started, some restrictions due to the emergence of the Omicron variant were introduced. This may or may not have had some effect on the data. Given these changing circumstances, caution should be applied when interpreting the results.\n\nThe Survey of Londoners 2021-22 also took place just before the full effects of the cost-of-living crisis began to set in. It is highly likely that the situations of Londoners have changed while analysis was taking place.\n\nOn this page there is a **headline findings report**, published on 30 September 2022, which provides descriptive results for the key headline measures and supporting demographic data collected by the survey. Accompanying this report are more detailed tables documenting the key results of the survey by a range of demographic and other characteristics, a short summary document presenting key findings from the survey, and a technical report for those interested in the survey\u2019s methodology. Further to these, a series of pen portraits, providing snapshots of particular groups of Londoners, as captured at the time of the Survey of Londoners 2021-22, were first added on 31 October 2022. Further pen portraits will be added in due course.\n\nAlso on this page, there is an **initial findings report**, that was published on 2 September 2022. This was published to provide timely evidence from the survey to support the case for further targeted support to help low-income Londoners with the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nWe have launched an **online explorer** where users can interrogate the data collected from the two surveys, conducted in 2018-19 and 2021-22. This is the first iteration, so we welcome any feedback on it - [**GO TO THE EXPLORER**](https://apps.london.gov.uk/survey-of-londoners)\n\nThe record-level Survey of Londoners dataset can be accessed via the\u00a0[UK Data Service](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=9043), University of Essex. The dataset is available for not-for-profit educational and research purposes only.",
