A local service is one that:\r\nis provided within Devon by an organisation based in Devon\r\nis provided within Devon by an organisation based outside Devon\r\nis provided close to the border of Devon.\r\n\r\nThe Directory\u2019s secondary function is to hold information on organisations providing services nationwide that may be useful to the people of Devon. \r\n\r\nThe term 'Devon' is the local authority area covered by Devon County Council. This does not include the unitary authority areas of Plymouth and Torbay which operate their own directories.\r\n\r\nThe Directory may refer users to other directories which hold comprehensive information on particular subjects, such as:\r\nActive Devon for physical activity and sport.\r\nYell.com or other sources for general trades and trades people that are not in short supply, for example, plumbers, electricians, builders, gardeners and hairdressers unless they offer discreet health and social care services and children\u2019s services.\r\nWhere DCC believes that including it would add value, the Directory may harvest data from other websites or receive regular data updates from other organisations, presenting such data in the Devon Community Directory, For example:\r\nCare Quality Commission data on care home and personal care providers.\r\nOfsted data on registered childcare.\r\nNHS Choices data on surgeries, hospitals and dentists.",
