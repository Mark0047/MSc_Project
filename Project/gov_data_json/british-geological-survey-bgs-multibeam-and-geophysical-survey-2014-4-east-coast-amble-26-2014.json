        "notes": "This marine multibeam and geophysical survey took place from 26 August \u2013 5 September 2014 in the area of the North East coast of England near Craster on board the RV White Ribbon. The survey was carried out by British Geological Survey (BGS) in collaboration with English Heritage and Wessex Archaeology. The aim of the survey was understanding submerged palaeo-environments in the southern North Sea: Pathways and timescales of hominin colonisation. Sea floor bathymetry data were collected using a Kongsberg EM3002D multibeam system. Sub bottom seismic profiling data were collected using an Edgetech 216S chirp system. These data are archived by BGS and are available for download. Multibeam bathymetry data can be accessed via the UKHO Bathy DAC, https://www.gov.uk/guidance/inspire-portal-and-medin-bathymetry-data-archive-centre. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS Report of Survey.",
