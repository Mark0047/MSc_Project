        "notes": "Loch Sween is one of several areas in the British Isles under investigation as a potential marine nature reserve, and a number of surveys have been carried out in recent years to collect information on littoral and sublittoral habitats, communities and species in the area. As well as recent surveys, Loch Sween has attracted much interest from marine biologists from as early as the 1900's, because of some special features. This report provides a review of the main work done in the littoral, and summary descriptions of the major littoral habitat and community types. The main features of the loch system, its geology, topography and hydrography are outlined, and their effects on habitats and communities present. A review of previous littoral studies in the area is given, with their major findings and conclusions. As well as a number of surveys of shore biota, marine biological investigations have also centred on the potential of some of the 'arms' of the loch system (particularly Linne Mhuirich) for shellfish farming. Some experiments on fertilisation of the water have been performed in Loch Craiglin. The major habitats in the area are littoral bedrock, boulders, pebbles and sediments at a range of exposure to wave action and tidal streams. Two brackish water lochans and a small rapids system are also present, and plant and animal communities in these various habitats are described briefly, including sediment infauna. Features of interest in the littoral are discussed, including aspects of zonation, the distribution of particular species and the diversity of communities and species in the Loch Sween area. Records currently considered sensitive have been removed from this dataset.",
