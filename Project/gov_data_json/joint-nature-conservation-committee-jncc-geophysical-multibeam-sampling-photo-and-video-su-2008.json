        "notes": "The JNCC marine survey was undertaken by CEFAS in April 2008 in the Dogger Bank area North Sea onboard the Cefas Endeavour. This work was in support of JNCC\u2019s requirement to recommend sites for designation as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) to UK Government, under the EC Habitats Directive. The aim was further developing methodologies for identifying and defining the extent of Annex I shallow sandbank habitat and to conduct new habitat mapping surveys to further develop and integrate geomorphological and biological survey methods and strategies to provide interpreted information in GIS for use in site designation and management of activities in the Dogger bank area. Multibeam bathymetry data were collected using a Kongsberg EM3000D and sidescan sonar data were collected using a Benthos SIS 1624. Groundtruthing techniques including video tows, Hamon grab sampling and beam trawling. The geology and geophysics component of the data are archived at the British Geological Survey (BGS) MEDIN Data Archive Centre (DAC) for Geology and Geophysics. Biological and bathymetry data are archived at DASSH and UKHO respectively. For more information see http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-4733, JNCC Report 429, available at http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-5076. Technical details of the survey are contained in CEFAS Cruise Report CEND 07/08.",
