Raw and processed data delivered to Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, UK (Cefas) complete with georeferenced mosaics and GeoTiffs images. A camera sledge survey of approximately one in every three target stations placed within the EHGF rMCZ, collecting video and stills images of the predicted sediment and habitats present. A mini Hamon grab (0.1m2) survey of 50 target stations within the EHGF rMCZ to collect sediment and associated infauna. These data are archived with the Marine Environmental Data and Information Network (MEDIN) Data Archive Centres (DACs) including the British Geological Survey (BGS) DAC for geology and geophysics, The Archive for Marine Species and Habitats Data (DASSH) and the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO) bathymetry DAC. The full site data package including raw is also available on request from BGS.",
