The platform provides a selection of official statistics and data outputs on a variety of themes related to DCLG\u2019s objectives including: Local Government finance, housing and homelessness, wellbeing, deprivation and the department\u2019s business plan as well as supporting reference data used to describe and link the data.</p>\n<p>This dataset provides information on local precepting authorities (parishes, charter trustees and Temples) and the amount of council tax collected on their behalf by their billing authorities in England, known as a precept, for the financial years 2013-14 and 2014-15. Data are collected from Council Tax Return Forms completed by local authorities. A process has been undertaken to match the parishes recorded to standard ONS codes, but it has not been possible to match Charter Trustees, Temples and 26 parishes, and therefore these will not appear in map(s) as they do not have an ONS Code.</p>\n<p>This is the linked data resource for Open Data Communities <a href=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/\">http://opendatacommunities.org/</a></p>\n",
