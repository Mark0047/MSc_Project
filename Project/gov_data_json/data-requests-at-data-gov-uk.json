The requests are made by anyone, using a form at data.gov.uk.\r\n\r\nOnly 'public' data requests are included in the data published here. Confidential requests can also be made, e.g. for commercial confidentiality. \r\n\r\nThere are two versions of the data:\r\n\r\n* v1 - missing a couple of fields. Live data (always up to date).\r\n* v2 - contains all the public fields. Produced nightly. System fields: nid, url, created, updated. Requester fields: title submitted_by data_themes status description suggested_use suggested_use_detail benefits_overview. Government response: publisher dataset_link field_review_notes.\r\n\r\nPolicy for requests: \r\n\r\n* a \"data request\" is a request for government to publish a dataset that is not yet published on data.gov.uk. Requests associated with specific datasets already on data.gov.uk should instead be made in a comment on the particular dataset page.\r\n* only central government and its agencies are available in these requests. For others organizations, contact them directly and consider making an FOI request.\r\n* your personal data should not be requested with this method - contact the relevant organization directly.\r\neach request will be directed to the relevant department by the Cabinet Office team.\r\n\r\n(These have been shown on the form since late 2015, and before that the policy varied)\r\n\r\nData requests on file date back to September 2012.",
