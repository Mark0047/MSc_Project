Prior to 2012, the data were taken from the Department for Communities and Local Government\u2019s Housing Strategy Statistical Appendix (HSSA). These data are used directly in the dwelling stock tenure split. A web link to this data source where you can find further information is given in the \u2018Data collection\u2019 section of this publication.\r\n\r\nA dwelling is defined (in accordance with the Census definition) as a self-contained unit of accommodation. Self-containment is where all the rooms (including kitchen, bathroom and toilet) in a household's accommodation are behind a single door which only that household can use. Non-self-contained household spaces at the same address should be included together as a single dwelling. Therefore a dwelling can consist of one self-contained household space or two or more non-self-contained household spaces at the same address.",
