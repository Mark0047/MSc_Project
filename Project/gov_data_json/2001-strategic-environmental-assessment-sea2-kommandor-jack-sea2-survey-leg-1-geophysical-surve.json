        "notes": "As part of as part of the  Department of Trade and Industry's (now Department of Energy and Climate Change) Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA2) a geophysical survey was carried out  in three different quarters of the North Sea: Norfolk Coast (Area 1), Dogger Bank (Area 2) and Fladen Ground (Area 3) from Kommandor Jack SEA2 Survey Leg 1, 2001. Multibeam, sidescan sonar and chirp seismic data were collected. \n\nThe survey was carried  to identify potential offshore Special Areas of Conservation (SACs). It was necessary to acquire data on specific features identified in the EU Habitats Directive, such as sandbanks and pockmarks, some of which might subsequently be defined as SACs. The survey was carried out in two legs. Leg one included the geophysical surveys in three different quarters of the North Sea as well as the charting which was used to guide the sampling and photographic work on the second leg.\n\nThe following data are available - 25 files of processed multibeam data. Screenshots of backscatter processing are also available.\nSide-scan mosaics. Images are available from 15 boxes.\nProcessed seismic data.\nCruise report",
