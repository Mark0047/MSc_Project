It is one of 17 Cefas data \nsources assembled.\n\nThe RV Cefas Endeavour has been routinely deploying Multibeam acoustic \nmeasurement techniques since 2005, with particular emphasis being placed on \nhabitat mapping projects (Brown and Vanstaen, 2008). As part of the \ncalibration of the various acoustic systems, a CTD cast is performed at \nrelevant stations to provide temperature data for the necessary calculation of \nsound velocity. The CTD used is a SAIV A/S SD204. Acoustic calibration data \nare stored along with the acoustic data, allowing temperature data to be \nextracted for this paper.",
