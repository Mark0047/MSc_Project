        "notes": "This survey was undertaken by Cefas as part of the CEFAS Historic surveys;\n\nStation and biological data collected during research surveys carried out by \nCefas (formerly Directorate of Fisheries) in seas around the UK, mostly in the \nNorth Sea, since 1902. The survey hauls are not laid out systematically as a \ngrid, as in current International Bottom Trawl Surveys (IBTS) and are widely \ndistributed over (especially) southern and central North Sea areas. Gears and \nprotocols were not standardised throughout, due to the long term nature of the \nseries. Surveys took place in each season. Data are lacking for the periods of \nboth World Wars. In some periods (e.g. the early 1900s), all species caught \nwere recorded, whereas in other periods (e.g. 1920s-30s), only the key \ncommercial species (e.g., Plaice, Sole and Cod) were recorded systematically. \nNote that some surveys targeted particular species (notably Plaice).\n\nSurvey took place between 28/05/1975 and 14/06/1975 on Tellina\n\nEquipment used during this survey :\n\n\n-   Otter Trawl BORIS FISH/PRAWN 600 Mesh, 20mm Liner, Rubbers\n\nSurvey operations were undertaken on 45 stations\n\n34 different species were caught on this survey",
