        "notes": "[THIS DATASET HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN]. This dataset contains soil respiration data from the Climoor fieldsite in Clocaenog forest, north-east Wales. Measurements began in March 1999 at the field site, and were repeated in approximately bi-weekly intervals until Oct 2013 (although there are some larger gaps for technical or logistical reasons in this 14 year dataset). The data were collected using 3 different methods/machines over the years: static chambers, soil respiration chamber and EGM-4 (from PP Systems), and soil respiration chamber and Li8100 (from Licor Biosciences). The method used is detailed in the data and described further in the supporting documentation. Full details about this dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5285/49a26df5-6b50-41f2-8d3a-c235eedc5cd1",
