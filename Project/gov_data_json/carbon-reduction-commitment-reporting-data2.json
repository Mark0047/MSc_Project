Data drawn from annual reports of Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) participants for the most recent compliance year. This dataset covers the UK. This data is used in the Annual Report Publication (ARP) under Article 75 of the legislation establishing the scheme - the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme  Order 2013. This provides for publishing this information on the basis of participants' annual reports plus details submitted when they registered for the scheme. The ARP is developed in conjunction with the other Government Departments and Regulators responsible for the scheme's design and implementation.\r\nIn phase 1 of the CRC scheme, we published information from participants\u2019 annual reports in the form of the \u201cPerformance League Table\u201d (PLT). The PLT was replaced by the ARP as part of DECC and the Devolved Administrations\u2019 simplification of the scheme during phase 1. Phase 2 consists of 5 consecutive compliance years commencing 2014/15 and due to simplification measures and changes introduced the data for Phase 2 is not directly compatible with Phase 1.
