This is usually increased during times of flooding etc.\nReadings are transferred via telemetry to internal and external systems in, or close to real time. This data may be transferred to these systems or users at different intervals varying, for example, from once per day during normal conditions to several times per day during a flood event.\nData for sites in Wales is included in the Open Data feed, but is owned by Natural Resources Wales (NRW). NRW also class the data as Open Data, and you may use it under the same terms as the England data (the standard Open Government Licence, available on The National Archives website).\nThis data is retrieved automatically and is unvalidated.  Estimates of flow (typically how many cubic metres per second).  Information is available for river gauging stations throughout England.  Technical information used for flow calculation at flow gauging stations is also provided. For example, crest tappings at a weir.
