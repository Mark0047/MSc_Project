        "notes": "Felling Licence Application (FLA) areas approved by Forestry Commission England. Anyone wishing to fell trees must ensure that a licence or permission under a grant scheme has been issued by the Forestry Commission before any felling is carried out or that one of the exceptions apply. You normally need to get permission from the Forestry Commission to fell growing trees. This is usually given in a Felling Licence or\nan approval under a grant scheme. In certain circumstances you may also need special permission from another organisation for any proposed felling. This sometimes applies even if you do not need a Felling Licence. Everyone involved in the felling of trees, whether doing the work or by engaging others, eg. the owner, agent, timber merchant or contractor, must ensure that a licence or approval under a grant scheme has been issued before any felling is carried out or that one of the exceptions apply. They must also ensure that the work is carried out in accordance with the terms of a\nForestry Commission permission. If there is no licence or other valid permission, or if the wrong trees are felled, anyone involved can be prosecuted. Do not begin felling until the Forestry Commission have issued a licence or other permission. Any felling\ncarried out without either a licence or other permission is an offence, unless it is covered by an exception. Full details are available in the Forestry Commission's booklet 'Tree Felling - Getting Permission'. This dataset differs from a standard FLA in the following way:\n\nThe dataset contains land (mostly near to roads) that Highways England maintain. A felling licence has been approved to cover a 5 year period following the recommendation in the agreed memorandum of understanding between the Forestry Commission and Highways England. The area delineated shows what could be thinned rather than what will be thinned and does not negate the requirements for consulting other statutory agencies. The licence provides Highways England with permission to undertake thinning operations for the removal of a proportion of trees in a forest, woodland or line after canopy closure, usually quantified by the percentage of\ncanopy cover or number of stems removed not usually exceeding 30% at any intervention. Felling outside of this definition may require additional licencing.\n\nAttributes: FEATDESC - Type of licence approved.
