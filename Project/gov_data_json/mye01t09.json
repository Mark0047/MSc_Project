Therefore small estimates should not be taken to refer to particular individuals.\r\n\r\n2. The migration element of the components of change have been largely derived from a data source which is known to be deficient in recording young adult males and outflows from Northern Ireland. Therefore the estimates are subject to adjustment to account for this and, while deemed acceptable for their use, will not provide definitive numbers of the population in the reported groups/areas. Further information is available in the Limitations section of the statistical bulletin:\r\n\r\n[NISRA 2022 Mid-year Population Estimates webpage](https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/2022-mid-year-population-estimates-northern-ireland)\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Time Period</b>\r\n\r\nEstimates are provided for mid-2001 to mid-2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology\r\n\r\nThe cohort-component method was used to create the population estimates for 2022. This method updates the Census estimates by 'ageing on' populations and applying information on births, deaths and migration. Further information is available at:\r\n\r\n[NISRA 2022 Mid-year Population Estimates webpage](https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/2022-mid-year-population-estimates-northern-ireland)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Geographic Referencing</b>\r\n\r\nPopulation Estimates are based on a large number of secondary datasets. Where the full address was available, the Pointer Address database was used to allocate a unique property reference number (UPRN) and geo-spatial co-ordinates to each home address. These can then be used to map the address to particular geographies. Where it was not possible to assign a unique property reference number to an address using the Pointer database, or where the secondary dataset contained only postcode information, the Central Postcode Directory was used to map home address postcodes to higher geographies. A small proportion of records with unknown geography were apportioned based on the spatial characteristics of known records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Further Information</b>\r\n\r\n[NISRA Mid-year Population Estimates webpage](https://www.nisra.gov.uk/statistics/population/mid-year-population-estimates)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContact: NISRA Customer Services\r\n02890 255156\r\n[census@nisra.gov.uk](mailto:census@nisra.gov.uk) \r\nResponsible Statistician: Jonathan Harvey",

Digital NI aims to help establish a culture within Northern Ireland that develops and enhances Digital capability not just through interactions with Government, but also with local companies and throughout communities. Within government the Digital Transformation Service is facilitating this cultural shift through a number of methods, transforming Government services, making data open and available and encouraging and coaching those who lack digital skills.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that opening up our data is the right thing to do in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the Public Sector in Northern Ireland. It has the potential to encourage new commercial opportunities and drive economic growth and innovation across public and private sectors.",
