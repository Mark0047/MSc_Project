        "notes": "Percentage of Troubled Families local authorities have identified and are committed to working with\n\n#### How the figure is calculated:\r\n\r\nThe figure is the number of all troubled families that have been identified by upper tier local authorities to date given as a percentage of all families that authorities pledged to turn around (as indicated in the published data - see link below).  \r\n\r\n#### Why is this indicator in the business plan?\r\n\r\nThe indicator is a measure of the progress being made by local authorities at this early stage of the Troubled Families Programme. Identifying the real names and addresses and all the various family members of families that are right for this programme is not always easy as we have targeted families for the first time whose range of problems will often cut across education, crime, worklessness and other issues. This involves lots of different local agencies sharing information and making an assessment about whether families they're individually working with are the right ones for this programme. \r\n\r\n#### How often is it updated?\r\n\r\nData is updated quarterly.\r\n\r\n####Where does the data come from?\r\n\r\nSelf-declarations by local authorities, which are provided to the DCLG Troubled Families Team.\r\n\r\n#### What area does the headline figure cover?\r\n\r\nEngland\r\n\r\n#### Are further breakdowns of the data available?\r\n\r\nBy local authority. For data at local authority level see:\r\n[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/troubled-families-progress-information-at-30-june-2013-and-families-turned-around-at-29-july-2013](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/troubled-families-progress-information-at-30-june-2013-and-families-turned-around-at-29-july-2013)\r\n\r\n#### What does a change in this indicator show?\r\n\r\nThese figures show the extent of progress in Local Authorities working towards their commitments for the programme. They come less than 13 months after the start of the programme and show that councils are on course to meet the Prime Minister's target.  We expect the figure to increase towards 100%, but we are not expecting local areas to identify all the families they will work with over the course of a 3 year programme at the start of that programme - as family circumstances may change by the time they are approached to be worked with. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Time Lag\r\n\r\n2 months\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Next available update\r\n\r\nTo be confirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Type of Data\r\n\r\nManagement Information\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Robustness and data limitations\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n#### Links to Further Information\r\n\r\n[https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/helping-troubled-families-turn-their-lives-around](https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/helping-troubled-families-turn-their-lives-around)\r\n\r\n#### Contact Details\r\n\r\n[CorporatePerformance@communities.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:CorporatePerformance@communities.gsi.gov.uk)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
