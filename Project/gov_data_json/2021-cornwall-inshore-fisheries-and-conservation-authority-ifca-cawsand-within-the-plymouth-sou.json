        "notes": "Cornwall Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority (Cornwall IFCA) carried out a survey to map the extent of the seagrass at Cawsand, within the Plymouth Sound and Estuaries Special Area of Conservation (SAC). The survey was carried out to provide Cornwall IFCA with an updated extent map of the seagrass. The seagrass at Cawsand is the only bed in the Plymouth Sound and Estuaries SAC which is within the Cornwall IFCA district, the remaining seagrass beds (Drake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Island, Cellar's Cove, Red Cove North,  Red Cove South, Tomb Rock, Jennycliff South, Jennycliff North and  Firestone Bay) are within the Devon and Severn IFCA district. \n     The aim of the survey was to map the extent and coverage of the seagrass bed at Cawsand within the Plymouth Sound and Estuaries SAC using a Biosonics MX Scientific Echosounder. In total 64 MX tows were completed of which 62 were included in the analysis. Sea conditions were favourable throughout the survey.",
