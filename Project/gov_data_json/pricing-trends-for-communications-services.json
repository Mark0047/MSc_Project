It examines the prices of standalone and bundled services and what consumers spend on them.\r\n\r\nIt also looks at how consumers engage with the market, illustrating how the prices paid by engaged consumers (those who shop around and are aware of their contractual status) who are currently within a minimum contract period, differ from prices paid by consumers outside a minimum contractual period.\r\nThe report also includes the results of our consumer engagement research, which looked at the reasons why consumers may not engage with the market.",
