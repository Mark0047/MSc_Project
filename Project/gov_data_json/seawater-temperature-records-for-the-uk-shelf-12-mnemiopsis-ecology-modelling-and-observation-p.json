        "notes": "This dataset has been extracted as part of an exercise to assemble \"all\" Cefas \nTemperature Data and publish it in a Data paper. It is one of 17 Cefas data \nsources assembled. The MEMO (Mnemiopsis Ecology Modelling and Observation) \nProject was part of a wider sampling programme in collaboration with Ifremer \nand ULCO (France), ILVO (Belgium) and Deltares (Netherlands). The data \ncollected were used to produce models (e.g. an Individual Biological Model, \nand hydrodynamic, ecosystem and socioeconomic models \u2013 Collingridge et al. \n(2014), Van Der Molen et al. (2015) that increased the understanding of the \nlife cycle of Warty Comb Jellyfish (Mnemiopsis leidyi), the interactions of \ngelatinous zooplankton within their ecosystem and the consequences of \nincreasing number of gelatinous zooplankton in European shelf seas for \nstakeholders (industry such as power plants, fisheries and tourism). The \nproject collected samples for analysis of fish larvae and fish eggs, \nmicrozooplankton and mesozooplankton and phytoplankton. CEFAS Cruises included \nwere: RV Endeavour 05/2011- Western English Channel (ICES area VIIE), RV \nEndeavour 05/2012 - Western English Channel (ICES area VIIE), RV Endeavour \n07/2012 - North Sea (Botney Gut/Silver Pit) & RV Endeavour 7X/2012 - North \nSea.",
