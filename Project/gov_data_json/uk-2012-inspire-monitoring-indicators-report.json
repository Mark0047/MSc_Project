        "notes": "The UK 2012 INSPIRE Monitoring Indicators Report provides information on UK progress towards implementation and use of the INSPIRE infrastructure.              It is a statutory requirement for member states to submit an annual INSPIRE monitoring report.  This will be the third annual report submitted by the UK.          The purpose of the Monitoring Report is to provide consistent information from across the EU, on progress towards implementation and use of the INSPIRE infrastructure.      This excel workbook is the UK\u2019s annual monitoring return.  This return has been compiled from discovery metadata records published on data.gov.uk in January 2012, verified and augmented with information including use of services, supplied by individual data providers.  Information in the report relating to Annex III data is the best available and gives a general indication of the range of data likely to be in scope. It does not represent a definitive list of A III datasets the UK will publish.        As the workbook is designed for data collection, rather than as a viewing tool, it is not easy to browse or examine.  \r\n\r\nFrom 2013 onwards, these reports can be found here: http://data.gov.uk/dataset/uk-2013-inspire-monitoring-indicators-report\r\n",
