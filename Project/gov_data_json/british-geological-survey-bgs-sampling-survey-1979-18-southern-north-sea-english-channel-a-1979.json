        "notes": "This sampling survey, aboard the drilling vessel Surveyor owned by Heerema Marine Contractors, was part of the British Geological Survey (BGS) Regional Mapping Programme and aimed to drill boreholes in areas covered by Quaternary sediments too thick for vibrocoring or gravity coring methods. The results would aid with the interpretation of shallow and deep seismic records used in the compilation of geological maps. The drill system was heave compensated with a derrick mounted over a moonpool and boreholes were drilled at seven sites.",
