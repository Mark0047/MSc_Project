For the same set of students, the data also include the percentage achieving 2 or more GCE/VCE A level passes or the AS level equivalent; and the percentage achieving 3 or more GCE/VCE A grades at A level. A breakdown by pupil gender for these variables is also included.

To determine whether a student belongs to this group, a set of criteria known as 'trigger criteria' has been established. These criteria state that students must be aged 16, 17 or 18 (at the start of the academic year), and they must have been entered for a GCE/VCE A level, or a VCE Double Award in the summer session of the academic year. Data based on school location rather than pupil residence and is available for maintained schools only.",
