        "notes": "FSP 2006/07 Programme 20, a trawl and jigging survey of squid off the North \nEast coast of England. The survey, on board the chartered vessel FV Nimrod, \nwas planned to take place during the fourth quarter of 2006 to coincide with \nthe period when squid were being caught in commercially viable quantities in \nthe area. A first trip took place from 14 to 20 December 2006 (Part 1) but \nfound very few squid, suggesting that squid had already moved away from the \nfishing grounds. The second trip took place from 11 to 17 October 2007 (Part \n2). That survey was one of two surveys which aimed at developing jigging as an \nalternative low-impact method to catch squid with little by-catch. The second \nsurvey took place off the Western English Channel and is reported separately.",
