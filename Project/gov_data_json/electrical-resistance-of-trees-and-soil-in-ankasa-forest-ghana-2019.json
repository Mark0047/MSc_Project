        "notes": "[This dataset is embargoed until January 2, 2025]. Measurements of tree resistance to ground and adjacent soils in the Ankasa Conservation Area located in southwestern Ghana. Tree species were selected as representative of the dominant species with diameter at breast height (DBH) ranging from 17.8 to 77.8 cm. The selected 20 trees had DBH ranging from 17.8 to 77.8 cm. In addition, measurements were extended to a single liana (Connarus africanus) with 7.0 cm DBH. Data on tree and soil resistivity were collected on the same 20 trees for both wet (March) and dry (September) season campaigns in 2019. Full details about this dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5285/c46028c6-1d2b-4b40-a174-39ea3fee2499",
