        "notes": "This Fisheries Science Partnership (FSP) project initiated a self-sampling \nprogramme, through collaboration between industry and scientists, to respond \nto the need of data. Fishers filled in dedicated logbooks with trip and haul \ndetails; measuring boards and (sub) sampling buckets were provided and were \nused by fishers to collect length frequency distribution measurements twice \nper months. An image recognition software was developed to automate the \ndigitisation of the handwritten logbooks and datasheets into spreadsheets. A \nsimilar sampling scheme was agreed with the relevant processors, who provided \ninformation on total catches per trip, length frequency distribution and \nindividual weights.",
