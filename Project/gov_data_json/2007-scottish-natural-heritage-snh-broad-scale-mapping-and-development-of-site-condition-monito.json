        "notes": "Many of the notified marine features of SSSI lie outwith the current suite of marine SAC and have yet to be subject to marine condition monitoring assessments.  The principal aim of this research was to formulate cost-effective and pragmatic solutions to the future monitoring of SSSI along with other intertidal marine features of interest that would meet the requirements of agreed monitoring standards.  Specific objectives of the research were to:\n     \u00c2\u00b7\tderive biotope maps of each site to show the location of features, biotopes and species of interest;\n     \u00c2\u00b7\testablish an appropriate baseline biological dataset that will permit an assessment of current site condition, and be a basis for comparison with future monitoring surveys;\n     \u00c2\u00b7\tdevelop simple cost-effective survey methods and guidance that could be used in the future by non-specialist staff, and which would be suitable for each of the study sites and any specific features therein; \n     \u00c2\u00b7\tin addition to the designated features within each site, develop guidance for monitoring egg wrack Ascophyllum nodosum ecad mackaii and beds of eel grass Zostera noltii and Zostera angustifolia.\n     Five SSSI and one SAC with marine interest features were chosen by SNH for study, these were Taynish Woods SSSI, Ulva, Danna and the McCormaig Isles SSSI, M\u00c3\u00b2ine Mh\u00c3\u00b3r SAC, Bridgend Flats SSSI, Gruinart Flats SSSI and Gribun Shore and Crags SSSI.  These sites covered a wide range of intertidal features for which sites around Scotland have been notified or designated.  Survey work was undertaken in August 2007, with a short break due to movement restrictions imposed on agricultural land during the outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease; the impact was Ulva, Danna and the McCormaig Isles SSSI was not surveyed.",
