Our primary focus for the future remains to \r\nresolve concerns fairly. However, we also have a duty to use what we know, to help to prevent the same thing happening again. \r\n\r\nWe are not a patient safety body and we cannot succeed in isolation, however we have a unique contribution to make to the patient safety system.\r\n\r\nOur new website is http://resolution.nhs.uk\r\n",
