They cover new General Needs lettings, at social rent levels, owned by Local Authorities (LAs). All figures are unweighted and are therefore not fully consistent with the weighted social rent data at national level in the 'Social Housing Lettings in England' statistical release.\r\n\r\nSome Local Authority areas are missing from the Local Authority owned datasets due to there being either no LA owned lettings in that area, or there being too few lettings in an area for the data to be released, as it is deemed disclosive.\r\n\r\nData are given for the tenant\u2019s reason for housing, as reported by the tenant. Some categories have been combined into \u2018Other\u2019 for disclosure purposes due to their sensitive nature and/or risk of re-identification.",
