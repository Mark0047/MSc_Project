The codes consist of a simple alphanumeric structure; the first three characters (ANN) represent the area entity (i.e. type; or category of geography) and the following six characters (NNNNNN) represent the specific area instance. The CHD provides multiple functionality including details of codes, relationships, hierarchies and archived data. The CHD can be used in conjunction with the Register of Geographic Codes (RGC) that summarises the range of area instances within each geographic entity. The GSS Coding and Naming policy for some statistical geographies was implemented on 1 January 2011. From this date, where new codes have been allocated they should be used in all exchanges of statistics and published outputs that normally include codes.
