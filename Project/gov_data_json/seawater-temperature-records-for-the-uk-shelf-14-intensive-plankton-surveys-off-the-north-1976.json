        "notes": "This dataset has been extracted as part of an exercise to assemble \"all\" Cefas \nTemperature Data and publish it in a Data paper. It is one of 17 Cefas data \nsources assembled.\n\nA series of 12 cruises was carried out in 1976 by DFR staff to investigate the \ndistribution, abundance, mortality and main predators of planktonic fish eggs \nand larvae of important commercial fish species (e.g. plaice, cod). The \ncruises secondary aims included the investigation of phytoplankton standing \nstock (via measurements of chlorophyll concentration, phytoplankton size and \nabundance) and of zooplankton biomass.\n\nPlankton samples were collected at each site on a planned survey grid. These \ndata consist of numbers of macroplankton from 8 of the samples collected from \nan area off the North East coast of England, along with associated positional \ndata and volumes filtered\n\nMeasurements of surface water temperature and salinity, and bottom \ntemperature, were carried out at each sampling station on a planned survey \ngrid (see below). Samples for the analysis of dissolved inorganic nutrient and \nchlorophyll concentration were also collected at the surface at each sampling \nstation.\n\nAll the hydrographic observations were made from the vessels (RV Corella and \nClione). Surface water temperature was monitored through a stainless\u2013steel \nship\u2013board pumping system. The pump had an intake 4 m below the water surface \nand delivered sea water to sensors set up in the ship\u2019s laboratory. The \ntemperature sensor (as well as the salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and \ntransparency sensors) was mounted in a Perspex box though which the pumped \nwater flowed continuously.\n\nThe measurement of temperature at the \u201cbottom\u201d at each sampling station was \nobtained from the chart records of the electronic depth gauge and thermistor \nsensors mounted on the plankton sampler.\n\nThe data collected during these cruises was presented in the \u2018Fisheries \nResearch Technical Report\u2019 n. 86 by Harding and Nichols in 1987. The original \nlog books from these cruises are in the Cefas plankton physical archive; some \nof these log books (e.g. containing plankton and icthyoplankton data) were not \ndigitised (because not relevant for the project).",
