This contains the two new combined authorities - Cambridgeshire and Peterborough and West of England. The names of the combined authorities in this product reflect those that are in common use, both within the areas and beyond. It should be noted that the names are not always the same as the names in the Statutory Instruments that established them. This is because the statutory names are often very long and not suitable for the presentation of statistics.\u00a0(File Size - 16 KB)<div><br /></div><div><div>Column Descriptions:</div><div><ul><li>CAUTH17CD | Text | 9<br /></li><li>CAUTH17NM | Text | 31<br /></li><li>FID | Number | 1<br /></li></ul></div></div>",
