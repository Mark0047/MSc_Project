A 2-m Lowestoft beam trawl with a 3 mm cod-end liner was \ndeployed for 5\u201310 min across each station at a speed of about 0.5 m/s. Data \nincludes information of the species found at each station.\n\nThe start and end of the haul positions were recorded. Tow length averaged \nabout 400 m, but varied substantially (s.d.=290) depending on tidal current \nvelocity and wind strength at the time of sampling.\n\nOn retrieval of the trawl, an estimate of sample volume was made, along with a \nsummary of the contents, noting especially the presence of stones, rock, etc. \nThe sample was then sorted on deck over a 5 mm mesh sieve.",
