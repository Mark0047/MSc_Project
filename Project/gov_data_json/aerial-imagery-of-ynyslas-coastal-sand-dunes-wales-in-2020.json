        "notes": "The data contains Aerial imagery of Ynyslas Dunes, Wales saved in a GeoTiff format. The imagery covers 8000 m2 of a discrete coastal sand dune at northern distal end of a spit in Dyfi National Nature Reserve. Data was collected during a six-minute flight on 5th February 2020 made by a DJI Mavic Pro 2 uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV). The flight was planned with Pix4DCapture based on a ground pixel resolution of 0.01 m. Lateral and longitudinal overlap was set to 80%. Prior to flying, eight (5.8 per 100 photos) Ground Control Points (GCPs) were evenly distributed throughout the dune and their location surveyed using a differential global positioning system (DGPS). Orthorectification and mosaicking of the aerial imagery collected was performed using Pix4Dmapper utilising a fully automated workflow based on Structure-from-Motion (SFM) digital photogrammetry algorithms. The data was collected to test the accuracy and repeatability of bare sand and vegetation cover in dunes mapped from aerial imagery. Data was collected and processed by Dr Ryan Wilson (University of Huddersfield) and interpreted by Dr Thomas Smyth (University of Huddersfield). The work was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council NE/T00410X/1. Full details about this dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5285/ac7071cb-79a3-400d-9f17-13dc4a657083",
