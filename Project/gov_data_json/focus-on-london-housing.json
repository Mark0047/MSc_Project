        "notes": "**FOCUS**ON**LONDON**2011: **HOUSING**:A**GROWING**CITY\n\nWith the highest average incomes in the country but the least space to grow, demand for housing in London has long outstripped supply, resulting in higher housing costs and rising levels of overcrowding. The pressures of housing demand in London have grown in recent years, in part due to fewer people leaving London to buy homes in other regions. But while new supply during the recession held up better in London than in other regions, it needs to increase significantly in order to meet housing needs and reduce housing costs to more affordable levels.\n\nThis edition of Focus on London authored by James Gleeson in the Housing Unit looks at housing trends in London, from the demand/supply imbalance to the consequences for affordability and housing need.\n\n**REPORT:**\n\nRead the report in [PDF format](https://londondatastore-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/fol/focus-on-london-2011-housing.pdf).\n\n![](https://londondatastore-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/fol/fol11-housing-cover-thumb.jpg)\n\n**PRESENTATION:**\n\nHow much pressure is London\u2019s popularity putting on housing provision in the capital? This interactive presentation looks at the effect on housing pressure of demographic changes, and recent new housing supply, shown by trends in overcrowding and house prices.
