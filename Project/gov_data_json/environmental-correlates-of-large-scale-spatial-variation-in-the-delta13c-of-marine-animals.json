        "notes": "Carbon stable isotopes can be used to trace the sources of energy supporting \nfood chains and to estimate the contribution of different sources to a \nconsumer's diet. However, the \u03b413C signature of a consumer is not sufficient \nto infer source without an appropriate isotopic baseline, because there is no \nway to determine if differences in consumer \u03b413C reflect source changes or \nbaseline variation. Describing isotopic baselines is a considerable challenge \nwhen applying stable isotope techniques at large spatial scales and/or to \ninterconnected food chains in open marine environments. One approach is to use \nfilter-feeding consumers to integrate the high frequency and small-scale \nvariation in the isotopic signature of phytoplankton and provide a surrogate \nbaseline, but it can be difficult to sample a single consumer species at large \nspatial scales owing to rarity and/or discontinuous distribution. Here, we use \nthe isotopic signature of a widely distributed filter-feeder the queen scallop \n(*Aequipecten opercularis*) in the north-eastern Atlantic to develop a model \nlinking base \u03b413C to environmental variables. Data includes catch data, \nisotope analysis data, environmental data and associated positional data.",
