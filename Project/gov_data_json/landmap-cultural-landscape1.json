        "notes": "      Landmap is a unique national information system, devised by the former Countryside Council for Wales (CCW), allowing information about landscape in Wales to be collected and organised into a nationally consistent dataset. The Landmap database includes both objective and subjective information and is designed to enable landscape quality to be taken into account in decision making.  Geographic dataset showing cultural landscape classification for Wales in the form of polygons (Aspect Areas) with large amounts of associated textual information, including General, Description, Evaluation, Recommendations, Tolerance to Change, Area Boundary, Evaluation and Bibliography.  The dataset records human activity that can be related to landscape, including major influences in art or literature wh\r\nich depicted or described the landscape, as well as more commonplace expressions of culture like farming type, or choice of building materials which creates a distinctive character in an area. Information is gathered by LANDMAP in order to inform sustainable decision making and to enable landscape to be taken into account during decision making processes. This dataset is important as landscape not only shapes, but is shaped by culture. The dataset will raise awareness and enable people to engage in landscape decision making in Wales.\r\n\r\nThis dataset has been superseded by Dataset: Landmap Cultural Landscape Services (metadata number:125279)\r\n    ",
