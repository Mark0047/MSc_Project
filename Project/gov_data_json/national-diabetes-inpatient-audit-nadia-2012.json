The audit is set out to answer the following questions: \r\n\r\nDid diabetes management minimise the risk of avoidable complications? \r\n\r\nDid harm result from the inpatient stay? \r\n\r\nWas patient experience of the inpatient stay favourable? \r\n\r\nHas the quality of care and patient feedback changed since NaDIA 2010? \r\n\r\nThis publication was produced in two parts: the comparative hospital-level analysis was published 14 March 2013 and the National Report was published 27 June 2013.\r\n\r\n",
