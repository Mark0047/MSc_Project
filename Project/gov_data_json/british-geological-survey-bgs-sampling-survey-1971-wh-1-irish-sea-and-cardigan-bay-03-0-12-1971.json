The purpose was to collect data for IGS Continental Shelf Unit 1as part of the ongoing UK regional mapping programme plus other projects. Thirteen boreholes were drilled in the north Irish Sea, twelve in Cardigan Bay and two in Caernarvon Bay. Sea floor data were collected using echo sounder and transit sonar. Sample data were collected using borehole wireline drilling, vibrocorer, gravity corer (rock and sediment), dredge and shipek grab. These data are archived by BGS. No BGS survey report currently available, IGS 1971 annual report contains summary.",
