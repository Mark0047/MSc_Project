Both the unemployment rate and the proportion who are unemployed in this age group are examined. In doing so, we explain how the unemployment rate is calculated, and how this measure is affected by changes in the proportion of people who are economically inactive. Data on the percentage of inactive young people in full-time education are also included in this release.\n\nSource agency: Office for National Statistics\n\nDesignation: National Statistics\n\nLanguage: English\n\nAlternative title: Young people in the labour market",
