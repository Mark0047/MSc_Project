        "notes": "These are OS 1:25000 paper maps (approximately 1400) upon which the Ministry of Housing and Local Government (currently Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG)) recorded hand drawn boundaries for permitted, withdrawn and refused mineral planning permissions and worked ground for every local authority area in England. Accompanying the maps is an associated card index (see metadata for MHLG Cards). Priority was placed on areas that were given rise to then current casework issues thus, at the time when the maintenance of the maps ended some authority information had been updated recently but other areas had not been visited for many years. Therefore, the variable completeness of the data should be kept in mind when the material is being used. Both the maps and the card index have been used to create the digital mineral planning permissions polygons (see metadata for MHLG Planning Permission Polygons). Polygons for worked ground have not been captured.",
