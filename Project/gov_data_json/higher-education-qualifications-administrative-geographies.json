The dataset is collected annually and is based on students obtaining a qualification at UK higher education institutions. The dataset is collected by the Higher Education Statistics Agency from higher education institutions throughout the UK and provided to the Department for Employment and Learning, Northern Ireland, for analysis. For 2013/14, NI Domiciled enrolments and qualifications at Open University are available. In previous years, these figures were included in NI students studying in England, as the administrative centre of the Open University is located in England.",

Digital NI aims to help establish a culture within Northern Ireland that develops and enhances Digital capability not just through interactions with Government, but also with local companies and throughout communities. Within government the Digital Transformation Service is facilitating this cultural shift through a number of methods, transforming Government services, making data open and available and encouraging and coaching those who lack digital skills.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that opening up our data is the right thing to do in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the Public Sector in Northern Ireland. It has the potential to encourage new commercial opportunities and drive economic growth and innovation across public and private sectors.",
