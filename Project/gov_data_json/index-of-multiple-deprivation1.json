        "notes": "__The Index of Multiple Deprivation__, commonly known as the IMD, is the official\r\nmeasure of relative deprivation for small areas in England. It is the most widely used of the Indices of Deprivation. The Index of Multiple Deprivation ranks every small area in England from 1 (most deprived area) to 32,844 (least deprived area) (2015). These small areas are called Lower-layer Super Output Areas.\r\n\r\n__The Indices of Deprivation 2015__ provide a set of relative measures of deprivation for small areas (Lower-layer Super Output Areas) across England, based on seven different domains of deprivation:\r\n* Income Deprivation\r\n* Employment Deprivation\r\n* Education, Skills and Training Deprivation\r\n* Health Deprivation and Disability\r\n* Crime\r\n* Barriers to Housing and Services\r\n* Living Environment Deprivation\r\n\r\nEach of these domains is based on a basket of indicators. As far as is possible, each indicator is based on data from the most recent time point available; in practice most indicators in the Indices of Deprivation 2015 relate to the tax year 2012/13. Combining information from the seven domains produces an overall relative measure of deprivation, the Index of Multiple Deprivation. In addition, there are seven domain-level indices, and two supplementary indices: the Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index and the Income Deprivation Affecting Older People Index. A range of summary measures are available for higher-level geographies which includes local authority districts, in 2015 there were 326 local authority districts. These are based on the geographic boundaries for these areas at the time of publication.\r\nThe Index of Multiple Deprivation, domain indices and the supplementary indices, together with the higher area summaries, are collectively referred to as the Indices of Deprivation. You will find attached to this dataset resources from not only the 2015 Indices but previous years as well.\r\n\r\nFurther information can be found at \r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/467901/English_Indices_of_Deprivation_2015_-_Frequently_Asked_Questions.pdf\r\n\r\n",
