        "notes": "This work was carried out as part of the Fisheries Science Partnership (FSP) \nprogramme. The primary objective of the project was to obtain data on the \ndifferences between the currently permitted and proposed new trawl \nconfigurations, principally to move from the widespread use of 80mm mesh cod \nend to a default of 100mm. This information will help to provide evidence on \nthe performance of more selective trawl configurations to inform on proposed \nchanges to technical measures regulations in the southwest otter trawl mixed \nfishery.\n\nFor this purpose, two trials lasting 6 days each took place in ICES Division \n7e on the twin-rig otter trawler Rockfisher (SU6) in the months of October to \nDecember 2020. The vessel conducted simultaneous comparative tows of the \ncontrol gear and two experimental gears. The first trial compared two trawls, \nboth with 100mm cod ends, and one with an 80mm square mesh panel (SMP) and the \nother with 100mm SMP. A total of 19 paired hauls were collected for this \ntrial. The second trial compared 100mm cod end with an 80mm SMP to an 80mm cod \nend with an 80mm SMP (as normally used by the vessel). A total of 14 paired \nhauls were completed for the second trial.\n\nAt each station sampled, shot and haul, positional, times, depths and towing \nspeed information were recorded, and for all species of fish length \ndistribution data were taken, including collecting data on the benthic \ncomponent of the catch.",
