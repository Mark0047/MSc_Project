        "notes": "A GIS Shapefile showing the extents of the Licenced Marine Disposal Sites for all \nof UK, including England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey and \nIsle of Man. Marine Disposal Sites are regulated under the London Convention / \nLondon Protocol of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), wherein disposal \nof waste at sea (\"disposal at sea\") is prohibited except for certain exempt \nmaterials (Annex 1 at \n`https://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/Pages/London-Convention-Protocol.aspx`_\n [accessed 6th June 2023]). To dispose of an exempt material at sea, a disposal \nsite must be identified, characterised and designated, such that reporting of \nannual disposal at sea volumes can be made to the IMO biennially, and OSPAR \nannually. This dataset comprises the repository of these designated sites.\n\nUpon designation, a site is considered \"Open\"; available to that regulator for \nlicensing. If the site has had no licensed disposals in more than 5 years, it is \nconsidered \"Disused\"; available to that regulator for licensing but may require \nadditional supporting evidence. If the site has had no licensed disposals in more \nthan 10 years, it is considered \"Closed\"; not available to that regulator for \nlicensing. A regulator can also request that an Open or Disused site with disposal \nactivity within 10 years be considered Closed on request. \n\nA number of these sites are considered \"historic\" or \"legacy\" disposal sites, \nwhich whilst being officially designated with the UK's ratification of the London \nConvention / London Protocol, were used before the treaty came into force. Sites \nidentified, characterised and designated after the UK's ratification are \nconsidered new disposal sites.\n\n\n\n\n.. _`https://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/environment/pages/london-convention-protocol.aspx`:\n    https://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/Pages/London-Convention-Protocol.aspx",
