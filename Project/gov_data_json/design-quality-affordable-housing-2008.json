        "notes": "A survey of the design quality of 218 affordable housing schemes, funded by the Housing Corporation. The survey was carried out in 2008. Surveyed housing schemes were new build and funded in either the 2004/2006 or 2006/2008 funding rounds. They had all been completed by the end of 2007, and built by development partnerships in operation at the time of the survey. Data for each housing scheme includes scores for 20 Building for Life criteria, responses to the on-site survey questions which relate to individual Building for Life criteria, and responses to questions for development lead partners about the procurement and design processes. Data also exists on the government region, local authority, context (urban/suburban/rural) and type of site (greenfield/brownfield). Data on development lead partner responses is not complete.\r\n",
