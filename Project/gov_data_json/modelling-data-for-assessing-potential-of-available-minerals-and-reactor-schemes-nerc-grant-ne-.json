(2) Results of enhanced weathering reactor optimisation with two objectives, namely energy consumption and space (area) requirement, which include the optimisation output for calcite weathering using trickle-bed reactor, calcite weathering using packed-bubble column and forsterite weathering using packed-bubble column. For each of them, the data includes key reactor design parameters, the two objectives, and key process characteristics (particularly, mass transfer performance and mineral dissolution rates).",
