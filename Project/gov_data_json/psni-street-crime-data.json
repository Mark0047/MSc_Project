Digital NI aims to help establish a culture within Northern Ireland that develops and enhances Digital capability not just through interactions with Government, but also with local companies and throughout communities. Within government the Digital Transformation Service is facilitating this cultural shift through a number of methods, transforming Government services, making data open and available and encouraging and coaching those who lack digital skills.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that opening up our data is the right thing to do in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the Public Sector in Northern Ireland. It has the potential to encourage new commercial opportunities and drive economic growth and innovation across public and private sectors.",

The forces upload these to a private server managed by the Home Office in the Government network, where the files undergo quality assurance.  \r\n\r\nCopies of the data from police forces in England & Wales is then sent to the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), where they try to match the crimes with any court results contained in their own records. The MoJ send any matching court results back to the Home Office, where they are integrated with the existing data.  \r\n\r\nAll data is then anonymised before being published to this site.  \r\n\r\nThe crime & ASB data supplied to police.uk are considered to be management information and will differ from the official statistics published by PSNI as they have been extracted from the police administrative system on different dates.
