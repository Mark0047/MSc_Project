        "notes": "This work was carried out as part of the Fisheries Science Partnership (FSP) \nprogramme. The trawler Luc SN 36 was chartered for 14 days between October and \nDecember 2015 to undertake trials in the *Nephrops* fishery off the North \neast coast of England. The specific objective was to modify the incline panel \nand the escape hole of the selective Net Grid trawl design to enable retention \nof marketable fish while still minimising catches of unwanted fish. The Net \nGrid is made of a 4-panel box section inserted into a standard two-panel trawl \ninto which an inclined sheet of netting is laced. On top of the box section in \nfront of netting grid is a fish escape hole. The netting grid acts as a \nphysical barrier and guides fish out of the escape-hole while *Nephrops* \npass through the netting to the cod end.",
