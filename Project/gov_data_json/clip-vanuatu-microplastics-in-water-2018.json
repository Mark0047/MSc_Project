The file \nalso contains information on blank used and contamination checks. The other \nfile contains spectrum analysis of particles carried out with a ATR-FTIR. A \nREAD-ME text file contains the description of columns content for the two csv \nfiles and a brief description of particles that have been analysed with the \nFTIR and photographed . A .zip file includes two folders with pictures of \nmicroplastics (particles with size less than 5 mm, Arthur et al., 2008) and \nmacrolitter in diameter (particles with size greater than 5 mm).",
