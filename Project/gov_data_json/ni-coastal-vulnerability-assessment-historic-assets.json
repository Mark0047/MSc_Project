It was created as part of the Baseline Study and Gap Analysis of Coastal Erosion Risk Management in Northern Ireland Study which was prepared by Amey Consulting with HR Wallingford for the Department for Infrastructure (DfI) and the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) in 2018. The Report is an important first step in identifying areas that may be vulnerable to coastal erosion and has identified a number of key issues for consideration in determining the way forward. The full report is found at https://www.infrastructure-ni.gov.uk/publications/baseline-study-and-gap-analysis-coastal-erosion-risk-management-ni As part of the study, a high-level preliminary vulnerability assessment of coastal erosion along the Northern Ireland coast was undertaken utilising data which was available at the time. The high-level assessment consisted of two stages: an Erosion Risk Appraisal (this layer) and a Vulnerability Assessment. The Vulnerability Assessment compared areas of high/medium/low erosion risk against physical asset value, historic asset value and natural asset value also at high/medium/low value. These layers are available on the ODNI Portal.",

Digital NI aims to help establish a culture within Northern Ireland that develops and enhances Digital capability not just through interactions with Government, but also with local companies and throughout communities. Within government the Digital Transformation Service is facilitating this cultural shift through a number of methods, transforming Government services, making data open and available and encouraging and coaching those who lack digital skills.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that opening up our data is the right thing to do in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the Public Sector in Northern Ireland. It has the potential to encourage new commercial opportunities and drive economic growth and innovation across public and private sectors.",
