Spatial coverage will vary considerably depending on drilling activity, collecting activity and donations. The majority of new data is from site investigation reports with concentrations in urban areas and along transport routes. Current collection over 1million records covering the whole of Great Britain with 50,000 new records added per annum. Some records date back to 1600 but the majority date from 1900 onwards.
