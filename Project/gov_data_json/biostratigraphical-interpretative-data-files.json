The data are filed under four subheadings: i. 1:50K sheet files (data relating to BGS mapping projects) for England & Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. ii. Offshore sheet files (data relating to BGS mapping projects) for the UK continental shelf and North Atlantic. iii. Offshore Quadrants (data relating to the hydrocarbons industry) (confidential). iv. Foreign biostratigraphy (in part confidential). v. General Palaeontology, Biostratigraphy & Taxonomy.",
