        "notes": "North-West Irish Sea Mounds Survey (2003, 2006 and 2007). The North-West Irish Sea Mounds are a group of bedrock outcrops between Northern Ireland and Scotland. The aim was to improve understanding of the habitats and communities identified as potentially containing Annex I reef habitat according to the EC Habitats Directive and to map the bedrock outcrops to enable JNCC to assess the areas suitability for selection as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). Data from four research cruises contributed to this project. 2007 surveys (21/01/2007-24/01/2007 and 25/02/2007) RV Corystes - drop down video and grab sample data. The first survey's video was poor quality due to poor visibility. 2006 survey (12/11/2006) RV Corystes - Grab sample data only. 2003 survey (01/06/2003-23/06/2003) RV Lough Foyle - multibeam, drop down video and grab sample data. Defra Natural Environmental Group Science Division (CRO 361) made a significant financial contribution to this work. Joint \u00a9 2007 DEFRA, JNCC and AFBI. The geology component of the data is archived at the British Geological Survey (BGS) MEDIN Data Archive Centre (DAC) for Geology and Geophysics. Biological and bathymetry data are archived at DASSH and UKHO respectively. For more information see http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-4736 and JNCC Report 410: http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-4493.",
