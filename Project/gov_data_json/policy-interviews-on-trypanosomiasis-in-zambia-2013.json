        "notes": "This resource contains anonymised policy interviews on trypanosomiasis in Zambia from 2013 conducted by Catherine Grant (Institute of Development Studies) and Noreen Machila (University of Zambia, Department of Disease Control). These interviews explore the differing opinions of various stakeholders in relation to trypanosomiasis, a widespread and potentially fatal disease spread by tsetse flies which affects both humans and animals. It is an important time to examine this issue as human population growth and other factors have led to migration into new areas which are populated by tsetse flies and this may affect disease levels. This means that there is a greater risk to people and their livestock. Opinions on the best way to manage the disease are deeply divided (Source: Author Summary- Grant, C, Anderson, N and Machila, N [Accepted] Stakeholder narratives on trypanosomiasis, their effect on policy and the scope for One Health, Public Library of Science Neglected Tropical Diseases (PLOS NTD). This was part of a wider research project, the Dynamic Drivers of Disease in Africa Consortium (DDDAC) and these interviews contributed to this consortium. The research was funded by NERC project no NE/J001570/1 with support from the Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation Programme (ESPA).
