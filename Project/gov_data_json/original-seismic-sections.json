Most data are within the UK onshore area; although there are some UK near-shore and offshore (North Sea, Irish Sea) and foreign data. Most data were acquired for commercial hydrocarbon exploration and subsequently provided to BGS for use on specific projects. Some data were acquired by BGS and other public-sector bodies, e.g. BIRPS (British Institutions Reflection Profiling Syndicate), for academic research. This data set is a master set; copies must be used for interpretation purposes. Documents stored rolled in tubes, approximately 10 sections per tube, approx 850 tubes. The data are mostly concentrated in areas prospective for coal, oil and gas.",
