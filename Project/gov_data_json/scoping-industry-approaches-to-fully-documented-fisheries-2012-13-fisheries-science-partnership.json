        "notes": "The proposed reform to the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) sets out a move to a \nland-all catch policy for EU fishing vessels, with a requirement for full \nreporting of fishing and onboard processing activity. Recent trials in several \nMember States for \u2018Fully Documented Fisheries\u2019 (FDFs) operating with catch \nquotas have demonstrated how Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM) technology can \nbe utilised to deliver the monitoring requirements for FDFs. However, both the \nfishing industry and fisheries managers recognise that REM may not be suitable \nfor all fisheries, so there is a need to evaluate REM alongside other \napproaches to documenting activity, such as observers, self-sampling and \nself-reporting reference fleets, so that each approach can be assessed in \nterms of its suitability and applicability to different fisheries. The main \nobjective of this study was to explore the applicability of different \ntechnology and approaches to the full documentation of catch for various types \nof fishing. This includes exploring whether the technologies can deliver the \ninformation required, what practical considerations need to be taken into \naccount, and what industry drivers and incentives are required to deliver \nfully documented catches. This information is required for the successful \ntranslation of the policy objective into practice. The project had the \nfollowing four main objectives.To establish:\n\n\n(  1.)What data are required to deliver fully documented fisheries\n(  2.)What mechanisms are available to collect the data required for full \n      documentation\n(  3.)What are the relative merits of different approaches and technologies\n(  4.)Whether different fishery characteristics might benefit from different \n      FDF approaches.",
