An assessment of the technical potential and deployment potential is made in Phases 1 and 2 of the study respectively, whilst Phase 3 considers a roadmap to deployment.\n\nThe accompanying reports are available on [the GLA website](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/environment/environment-publications/decentralised-energy-capacity-study-0)\n\n_**Data Download**_\n\nThe datasets consist of a series of Excel 2003 spreadsheets which outline the methodology and parameters used, along with detailed and summary results. The datasets for each phase are contained in a compressed file and should be used in conjunction with the reports. Note that some workbooks contain macros but these are not required for them to work so can be disabled on opening.\n\n[Phase 1 zip](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/londondatastore-upload/gla-decs-phase-1.zip) (31mb)  \n[Phase 2 zip](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/londondatastore-upload/gla-decs-phase-2.zip) (19mb)  \n[Phase 3 zip](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/londondatastore-upload/gla-decs-phase-3.zip) (17kb)",
