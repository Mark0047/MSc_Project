For the vast majority of Key Stage 1 appeals the reason for refusal is that to admit the child would breach Infant Class Size Legislation, however, for some schools Infant Class Size Legislation does not apply (primarily because if a child was admitted to these schools the class would not have more than 30 children per teacher).\u00a0For these schools, the argument against admission is that it would cause prejudice to the school and the children already in attendance if a further child were to be admitted. For appeals granted which state (not ICSL) the parent was able to evidence that admitting their child to the school would not cause prejudice to the school. Parents and carers can access further information on infant class size appeals on our website at [www.leeds.gov.uk](https://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/children-families-and-carers/schools-and-learning/school-places/admissions-appeals).",
