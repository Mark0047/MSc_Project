There may also be variation between hospitals in the way that they code diagnoses to the fourteen diagnosis fields in each episode, particularly primary diagnosis. For instance, they may code in the order in which the diagnoses were made or according to their perceived importance or complexity. This may affect whether a particular spell is selected for inclusion in the numerator of this indicator.#Deaths in the community prior to admission are not included as data about them are not available",
