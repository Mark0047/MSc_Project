        "notes": "This report describes the major littoral habitats and selected special sites together with their communities around Skomer Island and the adjacent Marloes peninsula. The information is provided in a format suitable for inclusion in a management plan for a proposed statutory marine nature reserve. Sites were selected as being representative of as wide a range of habitats as possible and include bedrock and boulder shores of various aspects and water surge areas and caves. A total of 22 sites were surveyed. Descriptions of these sites together with summaries of their associated communities are given and discussed in this report. Field data is presented in Appendix 1 and annotated species lists are provided in Appendix 2. A photographic record of the sites and communities was also submitted to the NCC. A catalogue of photographs is given in Appendix 3. The findings of this report are discussed in the light of those of previous studies. The chief features of the survey area are: a) the presence of classic examples of shores extremely exposed to wave action; b) shores which provide an exceptionally wide variety of other habitats and communities, and; c) a number of unusual microhabitats, all within a relatively small geographic area. The occurance of several species in the survey area at or near the northern limits of their geographic range contributes to the scientific interest of the area. In the light of this survey, it is recommended that detailed surveys of special habitats and the production of comprehensive species lists should be the aim of any future work. The littoral zone of Skomer Marine Reserve is assessed for its value as a conservation area.",
