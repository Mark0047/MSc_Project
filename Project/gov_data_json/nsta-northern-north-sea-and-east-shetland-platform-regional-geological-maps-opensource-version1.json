        "notes": "<p>As part of the NSTA's published 2018/19 Activity Plan, the  NSTA is publishing a set of regional geological maps for the Northern North Sea and East Shetland Platform. These maps represent the third set of deliverables from a 3 year contract with Lloyd's Register (LR) to produce a series of maps and associated databases for the whole of the UKCS. The first set of maps was released in July 2017 and comprised the Central North Sea and Moray Firth. The second set of maps was released in November 2017 and comprised the Southern North Sea.</p>\n<p>All data released with this set of geological maps is public domain data. The project has, however, benefited from a number of additional third party data sources which have been used to help inform final maps and/or derive interpreted products. These include the 21CXRM Palaeozoic project (which is now available in the public domain), PGS's North Sea Digital Atlas and East Shetland Platform Seismic interpretation project, Frogtech's East Shetland Platform Project, IGI's Source Rock Evaluation for the East Shetland Platform, CGG's Target database and relevant products available via the BGS's Offshore Geoindex. TGS are gratefully acknowledged for providing joined digital log data from LogLinePlus to enable the production of lithology curves. TGS and BGS are acknowledged for providing additional seismic data to help carry out the project and CDA are also kindly acknowledged for their support in downloading and providing much of the released well data to LR as part of this project.Due to the high level, regional nature of the project, the maps are being produced for the main geological time intervals e.g. Paleocene, Lower Cretaceous, Upper Jurassic. Each time interval includes the following products:</p>\n<ul><li>Depth structure maps</li><li>Isochore maps</li><li>Subcrop &amp; supercrop maps</li><li>Structural elements maps</li><li>Depositional facies maps</li><li>Reservoir distribution maps</li><li>Source rock maps</li><li>Well penetration maps</li><li>Hydrocarbon occurrence maps</li></ul>",
