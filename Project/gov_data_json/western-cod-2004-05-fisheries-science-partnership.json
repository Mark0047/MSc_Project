The first two surveys took place in spring 2004 and \n2005 on FV Our Josie Grace, a commercial trawler based in Ilfracombe. \nProgramme 7 in 2006 used the same vessel for 20 days between 5 February and 17 \nMarch. Tows were carried out in and close to the three ICES rectangles closed \nto fishing in spring, and in the Bristol Channel, using twin-rig and \nsingle-rig nets with 85mm codends. The objectives of the 2006 FSP survey were \nto investigate the potential of the western cod FSP survey for providing \ntime-series data on abundance and population structure of cod, and to examine \nthe distribution of a range of species in and near the closed rectangles.",
