        "notes": "This survey was undertaken by Cefas as part of the CEFAS Historic surveys;\n\nStation and biological data collected during research surveys carried out by \nCefas (formerly Directorate of Fisheries) in seas around the UK, mostly in the \nNorth Sea, since 1902. The survey hauls are not laid out systematically as a \ngrid, as in current International Bottom Trawl Surveys (IBTS) and are widely \ndistributed over (especially) southern and central North Sea areas. Gears and \nprotocols were not standardised throughout, due to the long term nature of the \nseries. Surveys took place in each season. Data are lacking for the periods of \nboth World Wars. In some periods (e.g. the early 1900s), all species caught \nwere recorded, whereas in other periods (e.g. 1920s-30s), only the key \ncommercial species (e.g., Plaice, Sole and Cod) were recorded systematically. \nNote that some surveys targeted particular species (notably Plaice).\n\nSurvey took place between 05/03/1908 and 09/04/1908 on Huxley\n\nEquipment used during this survey :\n\n\n-   Beam Trawl 2m shrimp net fryma liner 3 chains x\n-   Grimsby style otter trawl Codend with mesh 6.8cm\n-   Lowestoft smack beam trawl 43ft 13.1m\n-   Lowestoft smack beam trawl 43ft 13.1m fine mesh\n\nSurvey operations were undertaken on 53 stations\n\n35 different species were caught on this survey",
