This data is based on the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) Statistical Data Return or SDR; the latest release is based on data from the 2013/14 return as at 31 March 2014 The full data spreasheet is available at <a href=\"http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/ourwork/sdr-statistical-releases\">http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/ourwork/sdr-statistical-releases</a></p>\n<p>This local directory simply seeks to demonstrate the range of housing providers active in the seven districts of our sub-region and the main \"types\" of housing these providers own and manage. Additionally the directory provides a web address for each provider and a count of the number of distrcits, within our group of 7, which this organisation owns / manages homes within.</p>\n<p>The source data includes numbers of homes each organisation owns and manages. In this directory we simply highlight whether the organisations owns or manages ANY homes in our area due ot some of the complexities around the numbers reported. Click here for a definition of stock figures used in the source SDR The SDR is updated annually and published around September each year. It is currently publised at (HCA webiste) however will be moving to .gov.uk imminently. Before the next update is issued the the HCA, there will be changes to stock numbers due to conversions, demolitions and new build. There are also likely to be changes to the Providers (merging, forming groups, closing etc) during the year, but the data in this directory looks only to the SDR. Our local directory will be updated annually, as and when the HCA publishes its annual data.</p>\n",
