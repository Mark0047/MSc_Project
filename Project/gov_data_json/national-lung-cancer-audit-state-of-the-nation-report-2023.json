        "notes": "The National Lung Cancer Audit (NLCA) evaluates how the care received by patients diagnosed with lung cancer in England and Wales compares with current recommended practice and provides information that supports healthcare providers, commissioners, and regulators to improve the care for patients. The NLCA reports a set of process and outcome measures that cover important aspects of the care pathway for patients with lung cancer.\r\n\r\nIn the first NLCA State of the Nation report, we give an overview of the patterns of care and outcomes for 34,478 patients diagnosed with lung cancer in England in 2021. A separate section provides detailed results on the care received by 2,244 patients diagnosed in Wales in 2020 and 2021.\r\n\r\nThe report describes the results of an analysis using data provided by the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS) and the Welsh Cancer Network. It summarises the performance of lung cancer services in 2021, and compares this to the situation in 2019 and 2020.\r\n\r\nIndividual provider results are available. These enable regional and national comparisons to support local QI. In addition, there is a patient and public version of the report available.",
