        "notes": "This data set gives annual figures for the number of house building completions per 1000 households.\n\nHouse building data are collected at local authority district level and are available on ODC [here](http://opendatacommunities.org/data/house-building/completions/tenure). Figures for annual house building completions are derived from live table [253](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/311426/LiveTable253.xlsx). \r\n\r\nHouse building completion \u2013 In principle, a dwelling is regarded as complete when it becomes ready for occupation or when a completion certificate is issued whether it is in fact occupied or not. In practice, the reporting of some completions may be delayed and some completions may be missed if no completion certificate was requested by the developer or owner, although this is unusual.\r\n\r\nHousehold figures are derived from 2014-based household projections by district, available on ODC [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/536731/Household_Projections_Published_Tables.xlsx). The assumptions underlying national household and population projections are based on demographic trends. They are not forecasts as, for example, they do not attempt to predict the impact of future Government policies, changing economic circumstances or other factors that might have influence household growth. The projections show the household numbers that would result if the assumptions based in previous demographic trends in the population and rates of household formation were to be realised in practice.",
