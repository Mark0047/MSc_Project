        "notes": "This dataset contains LiDAR scans as Faro Scene files of 53 scans which cover 15 different fossiliferous surfaces. The number of scans per surface varies depending on the topology of the bedding plane. These LiDAR scans were made in Newfoundland, Canada, from Mistaken Point Ecological Reserve (10 surfaces), Discovery Geopark (4 surfaces) and Ferryland (1 surface). 45 scans were made in July 2022 and 8 in September 2022. The scans were made in order to enable the mapping of fossil specimens within their communities so that spatial analyses can be used to infer the underlying biological and ecological processes than govern Ediacaran eco-evolutionary dynamics. The dataset is complete to reconstruct the bedding surfaces accurately.",
