The Fishing Survey System (FSS) is a purpose\u2013built database \nused to hold and maintain Cefas fish survey data, primarily from government \nmandated surveys. This SQL database holds the main research and charter vessel \nfishing surveys data from 1901 to present. It includes station, catch, length, \nand biological data. Easy to access user front end for storing and editing \nmost forms of survey vessel data. Individual surveys grouped by their parent \ncruise series. Three current sections are shellfish, Fisheries Science \nPartnership and standard fisheries surveys. Fish stock monitoring survey \nstations, provide the main source of temperature data. This dataset also \nstretches the UK Shelf Waters designation, including a single coastal \nGreenland survey in 1959 and Arctic surveys in 1930 and 1949\u20131959.",
