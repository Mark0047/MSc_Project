        "notes": "The spreadsheet gathers the data collected during two experiments conducted on a synthetic sandstone core sample to assess geophysical monitoring techniques, storage capacity evaluation and the geomechanical integrity of shallow CO2 storage reservoirs. The tests were conducted in the rock physics laboratory at the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, during 2016, as part of the DiSECCS project with funding from the United Kingdom's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC grant EP/K035878/1) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). One experiment was a steady state brine-CO2 flow-through test (so called BTFT in the spreadsheet) to simultaneously evaluate storage capacity and identify pore fluid distribution and mechanical indicators during CO2 geosequestration. The confining and pore pressure conditions were similar to those estimated for shallow North Sea - like storage reservoirs, but simulating inflation/depletion cyclic scenarios for increasing brine:CO2 fractional flow rates. The second experiment focused on the assessment of geomechanical changes (the so called GAT in the spreadsheet) during and after CO2 storage activities under the same stress conditions. The data include ultrasonic P- and S-wave velocities and their respective attenuation factors and axial and radial strains in both tests, and electrical resistivity in the case of the flow-through test.",
