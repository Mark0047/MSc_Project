        "notes": "This data represents NIEA surveys and may not represent the entire extent of habitat or species across Northern Ireland. The research focused on identifying fens in Counties Down and Armagh where the incidence of inter-drumlin fens is high. These fens are particularly important within Annex 1 of the Habitats Directive. The most extensive and diverse priority Lowland Fens and Reedbeds have also been identified in county Tyrone through surveys by HST. This only represents a partial dataset and does not include the complete priority Lowland Fen and Reedbed resource in Northern Ireland. Where point data only is available for older fen surveys across Northern Ireland, further mapping is required to provide a fuller representation of all priority fen communities in Counties Fermanagh, Derry/Londonderry and Antrim. Upland Flushes, Fens and Swamps are largely unrecorded.",

Digital NI aims to help establish a culture within Northern Ireland that develops and enhances Digital capability not just through interactions with Government, but also with local companies and throughout communities. Within government the Digital Transformation Service is facilitating this cultural shift through a number of methods, transforming Government services, making data open and available and encouraging and coaching those who lack digital skills.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that opening up our data is the right thing to do in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the Public Sector in Northern Ireland. It has the potential to encourage new commercial opportunities and drive economic growth and innovation across public and private sectors.",
