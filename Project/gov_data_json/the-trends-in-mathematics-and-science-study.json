A total of 63 countries and 14 benchmarking jurisdictions participated in TIMSS 2011.  The survey included an assessment of pupils' mathematics and science ability, a survey of pupils' background characteristics and attitudes towards school and learning, and a survey of their mathematics and science teachers including their qualifications, instructional time dedicated to various topics, and the school environment for teaching and learning.\n\nThe Department owns the data collected from students in England in the most recent study 2011 and will also hold matched data files of the TIMSS data with pupils' NPD records once the contract with the national survey administrators expires.",
