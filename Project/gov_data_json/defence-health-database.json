This covers, casualty, mental health, Aeromedical evacuations, Medical counter measures, Operational deployment, Medical discharges, Medical Downgradings, Deliberate Self Harm, FMED1022 Safety Information. These are currently held as Access databases on the Asante infrastructure. A project is currently ongoing to move these to the NEMESIS application servers. These systems have an anonomised service number to prevent individuals being easily identified from the data. From the current systems there is a large number of copies of each of the databases - taken at various points in time to answer Parliamentary Questions, these like the manpower files are retained indefinitely.",
