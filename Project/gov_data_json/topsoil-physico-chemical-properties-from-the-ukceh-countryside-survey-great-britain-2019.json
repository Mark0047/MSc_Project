        "notes": "[THIS DATASET HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN]. This dataset consists of measures of topsoil (0-15cm) physico-chemical properties from soils sampled from the first 100 1km squares across Great Britain in 2019 as part of a rolling soil and vegetation monitoring program of 500 1km squares repeated every 5 years. The properties included are: soil organic matter (loss on ignition (LOI)), derived carbon concentration, total soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen, Olsen-phosphorous, pH, electrical conductivity, soil bulk density of fine earth and fine earth volumetric water content. The UKCEH Countryside Survey is a unique study or 'audit' of the natural resources of the UK's countryside. The sample sites are chosen from a stratified random sample, based on a 15 by 15 km grid of GB. Surveys have been carried out in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2007 by the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH) and predecessors, with repeated visits to the majority of squares. The countryside is sampled and surveyed using rigorous scientific methods, allowing us to compare new results with those from previous surveys. In this way, we can detect the gradual and subtle changes that occur in the UK's countryside over time. In addition to soil data, vegetation species data are also gathered by the current phase of the Countryside Survey. This work was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council award number NE/R016429/1 as part of the UK-SCAPE programme delivering National Capability.
