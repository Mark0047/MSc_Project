            "description": "The Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) serves the environmental science community through four data centres, data analysis environments, and participation in a host of relevant research projects.\r\n\r\nWe aim to support environmental science, further environmental data archival practices, and develop and deploy new technologies to enhance access to data. Additionally we provide services to aid large scale data analysis.\r\n\r\nYou can learn more about our data centres, our data processing services, and project work using the links in the menu above. \r\n\r\nIf you have a particular project or data management issue that you would like to consult CEDA on please contact us and a member of the CEDA team will be happy to assist.\r\n\r\nThe Centre for Environmental Data Analysis, based within the RAL Space department of the Science and Technology Facilities Council's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, hosts a range of activities associated with environmental data archives. \r\n\r\nThese activities include running a number of key environmental data centres for the environmental research community as well as being in the vanguard of the development of data archival and delivery practices and technologies.
