        "notes": "A database of environmental input parameters for River Invertebrate Prediction and Classification System (RIVPACS Model 44) implemented in a new version of the River Invertebrate Classification Tool (RICT). \n\nThe model predicts the invertebrate biological communities (species composition, abundance and value of biotic indices) at any site if its environmental quality was minimally impacted by people.\n\nThe database contains abiotic environmental parameters from geographical information systems for the river network of Great Britain on a 50 m grid based on the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) Intelligent River Network. It includes the start and end location of the river segment on the Intelligent River Network on a 50m grid so that users can identify the river segment for which they want data.\n\nThe data is delivered to users from an online GIS system that allows them to select a location by Ordnance Survey grid reference, select an area and extract data for up to 9 river segments within that area.\n\nFor user documentation and guidance please see the link to RICT user documentation in the data resources  available below.
