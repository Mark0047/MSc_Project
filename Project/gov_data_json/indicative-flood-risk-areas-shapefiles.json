It has been superseded by data for Flood Risk Areas: https://environment.data.gov.uk/dataset/f3d63ec5-a21a-49fb-803a-0fa0fb7238b6\n\nSet of shapefiles defining Indicative Flood Risk Areas for local risk.  Indicative Flood Risk Areas are provided by the Environment Agency for use by Lead Local Flood Authorities in England in their review during 2017 of Preliminary Flood Risk Assessments and Flood Risk Areas under the Flood Risk Regulations.\n\nThe Indicative Flood Risk Areas are primarily based on an aggregated 1km square grid Updated Flood Map for Surface Water (1 in 100 and 1000 annual probability rainfall), informally referred to as the \u201cblue square map\u201d. These are 1km grids across England and consist of the following data layers:\n\n\u2022\tSurface Water Flood Risk Exposure Grid \u2013 1km square grid that shows places above the flood risk threshold defined, using the 1 in 100 and 1000 annual probability (deep) Flood Map for Surface Water.\n\u2022\tFlood risk thresholds used to generate the \u201cblue Squares\u201d:\n-\tNumber of people > 200\n-\tNumber of critical services, including electricity and water > 1\n-\tNumber of non-residential properties > 20 \n\u2022\tCluster Maps \u2013 are aggregations of 3km by 3km squares that each contain at least 5 touching \"blue squares\" (i.e. 1km grid squares where one of the thresholds above is exceeded)\n\u2022\tCommunities at Risk by Lead Local Flooding Authority\n\u2022\tPeople Sensitivity Map by Lead Local Flood Authority.
