        "notes": "Broadband seismic data collected as part of the Macquarie Ridge experiment from 2020-2021. OBSs were deployed around Macquarie Island, while terrestrial stations were deployed on Macquaire Island itself. The data sources are as follows: (1) 3-component broadband data from 10 IGGCAS stations with 60s corner period, plus hydrophone data. (2) 3-component broadband data from 5 Guralp Libre stations with 60s corner period, plus hydrophone data. (3) 3-component broadband data from 5 Guralp Certimus stations located on Macquarie Island. Four instruments only recorded for ~2 months, while the remaining instrument managed about 8 months of recording. Further details on the experiment can be found in Tkal\u010di\u0107, H., C. Eakin, M.
