        "notes": "This dataset holds daily data from one automated weather station (AWS) located at the Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest, North East Wales. The data are on relative humidity (percent), air temperature (degrees Celsius), rainfall (millimetres), air pressure (millibars), net radiation (millivolts), solar radiation (kilowatts per square metre per second), photosynthetic active radiation (PAR; micromol per square metre per second), wind speed (metres per second) and wind direction (degrees). The data is an extension for the AWS datasets 1999-2015, 2015-2016 and 2016-2021 covering the time period January 2022 to December 2023. Data are logged in minute intervals, averaged to half-hourly. The data are sent from the field site to a UKCEH server. A working copy is created, quality assurance checks carried out and daily averages calculated from half-hourly records. Data which were not recorded are marked with \u201cNA\u201d, faulty data were replaced by \u201c-9999\u201d. Note, the rainfall sensor was broken during this time period, but the column is kept in the datafile for consistency with previous data records. Data collection, processing and quality checking was carried out by members of UKCEH staff. The Climoor field experiment intends to answer questions regarding the effects of warming and drought on ecosystem processes. The reported data are collected to monitor site specific environmental conditions and their development over time. These data are important to interpret results that are collected from the climate change manipulations imposed in the field.
