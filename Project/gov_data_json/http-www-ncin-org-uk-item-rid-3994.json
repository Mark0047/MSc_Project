Cancer Registration: Trends in incidence of common cancer in adolescents and young adults in England (1985-2016) [Data set]. Public Health England. https://doi.org/10.25503/cbbh-vg22\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis data set contains patient level data for common cancers in adolescents and young adults in England between the years 1985 to 2016.\r\n\r\nMale cancers included in the dataset are: testis (C62), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (C82-C85), rectosigmoid junction/rectal (C19/C20), and colon (C18)\r\n\r\nFemale cancers include: breast (C50), cervix uteri (C53), thyroid (C73), rectosigmoid junction/rectal (C19/C20), and colon (C18)\r\n\r\nVariables included:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Pseudonymised Patient ID\r\n\r\n\u2022 Patient age (in 5- or 10-year bands)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Sex (1=M, 2=F)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Diagnosis year (in 5-year bands)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Basis of diagnosis (coded as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, &) \r\n\r\n\u2022 Death certificate only (DCO) (coded as Y=Yes and N=No)\r\n\r\n\u2022 4-digit ICD10 code (for colon)\r\n\r\n\u2022 3-digit ICD10 code (for all other sites)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Histology code/description (5-digit code) \r\n\r\n\u2022 Grade of cancer \r\n\r\n\u2022 Laterality (if relevant, coded as; 1, 2, 3, 9, &, B, L, M, R) \r\n\r\n\u2022 Pathology stage (coded as 0,1, 2, 4, 5, 6, ?, 1A, 1A1, 1A2, 1B, 1B1, 1B2, 1C, 1E, 1S, 2A, 2A1, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, 4A, 4B, U, X) \r\n\r\n\u2022 Stage best (coded as, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &, ?, 1A, 1A1, 1A2, 1B, 1B1, 1B2, 1C, 1E, 1S, 2A, 2A1, 2A2, 2B, 2C, 2E, 2S, 3A, 3B, 3E, 3S, 4A, 4B, 4C, 4S, U, X) \r\n\r\n\u2022 Quintile deprivation index from 2015 (for years 2012-2016) (Quintile score [1-5], describing income deprivation where 1= least deprived to 5= most deprived)\r\n\r\n\r\nData for years 1985-1994 has been extracted from the ONS Incidence Dataset. Data for years 1995-2016 has been extracted from Cancer Registration database. Caution must be taken when using older data as it is not of as high a quality as data from more recent years. Differences in the registration process over time will explain some differences seen in the data. Additionally, improvements over time in the coding accuracy and methods used to identify cancers (e.g. biopsy, imaging) will be responsible for some of the increases in the registration of certain cancers. More information about the cancer registration process and database used can be found here: Data Resource Profile: National Cancer Registration Dataset in England (https://academic.oup.com/ije/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ije/dyz076/5476570). \r\n\r\n'Histology coded' applies different coding systems depending on the diagnosis year of the given tumour. Tumours diagnosed from 1985-1989 are coded using MOTNAC (Manual of Tumor Nomenclature and Coding), tumours from 1990-1994 use ICD-O, and cases from 1995-2016 use ICD10. Histolology coded description and pathology stage are not available for data from 1985-1994. The variable 'Stage best' is not equivalent in the two different datasets and should not be compared.\r\n",
