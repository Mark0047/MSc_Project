        "precision": "#Figures are rounded to the nearest 10pounds.#Change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the Section 52 form from the DfES.  2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. The change in sources is shown by the dotted line. From 2002-03 the combined LA and school based expenditure is calculated by Section 52 Outturn Table A line 51 net current expenditure (NCE) plus line 60 NCE (with adjustments to income to take account of School Standards Grant and Standards Fund scored here) plus lines 61 to 74 NCE. For 2001-02 and earlier years the expenditure is calculated as line 27 NCE after recharges for columns (b) to (f) and (h) plus line 15 from the remaining continuing education columns (g, i and j). This is taken from Section 52 Outturn Table 3 for 1999-00 to 2001-02 and from the RO1 form previously. Sector breakdown for combined LA and school based expenditure is not available from 2002-03 and consequently this table shows the total LA recurrent expenditure (except youth and community) per pupil by LA since 1995-96.",
