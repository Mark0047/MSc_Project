The model includes a collection of thermal stability data on Hepatitis E virus (HEV) in the published literature and generated by the contractors. The model uses these data in different matrices such as food, saline and plasma to predict the impact of different time-temperature treatments on HEV titres. The model is constructed in R, and uses a Shiny app within RStudio.",
