        "notes": "A desk-based study was undertaken to address the increasing need for a \nstrategic approach to industry-led data collection in the face of reducing \nresources and growing need for evidence in fisheries management. The aim was \nto establish partnerships and action plans that will support the inclusion of \nfishing industry knowledge and data in the evidence-base for managing UK \nfisheries.\n\nThree main activities were used to progress the study:\n\n\n-   \u2022 A review of existing initiatives that have incorporated industry \n    generated data into fisheries management advice and their degree of \n    success.\n-   \u2022 A rapid appraisal of data deficient UK targeted stocks, assessment of \n    data needs/gaps that may be augmented by industry generated data, and \n    selection of case study stocks.\n-   \u2022 Development of action plans on how data gaps for case study stocks of \n    commercial importance to UK fleets could be filled by the industry.",
