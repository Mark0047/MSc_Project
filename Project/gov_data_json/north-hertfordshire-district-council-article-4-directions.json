        "notes": "This Article 4 Directions layer describes areas that have special planning regulations adopted by a Local Planning Authority to provide additional powers of planning control in those particular locations. The regulations operate by removing \"Permitted Development\" rights over certain specified classes of minor alterations and extensions, such as porches, replacement of windows and doors and painting of the exterior of a building. Usually these Directions only relate to those facades of the building facing onto a street or public footpath or open space, but sometimes they cover alterations and extensions at the rear or developments such as sheds in back gardens.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these Article 4 Directions is that planning permission is required for these minor developments that would otherwise not require an application for planning permission. This enables the council to control these minor developments so as to ensure that they accord with its policies to protect the character of a Conservation Area or the visual amenities of other areas and prevent developments that do not accord with those policies.",
