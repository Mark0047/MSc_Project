        "notes": "This dataset contains an annual summary of the car parking account from South Lakeland District Council. \r\n\r\nPlease note; figures published in April are interim figures and will be updated later in the year once the final accounts have been audited.\r\n\r\nThese include a breakdown of the income and expenditure on the parking account. SLDC\u2019s car parking account only relates to the off-street car parks that it owns or manages; it does not collect for, or enforce any on-street parking. \r\n\r\nExpenditure includes cost for the provision and maintenance of designated off street parking places by the local authority. \r\n\r\nSurplus statement: \r\nThere are strict rules established by Government that stipulate how surplus parking funds are spent, but there are differences between on and off-street parking Any surpluses from on-street parking and both on and off-street enforcement must be used in accordance with section 55 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. This means that any income remaining after enforcement costs must be used for transport. Income from off-street parking fees and charges can be for general use by the local authority. \r\n\r\nThe Council only operates off-street car parks and enforcement of them. This authority has to balance the parking needs of residents plus a much-increased transient population visiting the area. We are always looking at ways of improving use of our car parks, such as increasing capacity of underused car parks. There has been no overall increase in tariffs since 2011-12 and lower charges or new tariffs have been established with the aim of making best use of resources and reducing congestion. For example, we have introduced an \u2018Early Bird\u2019 tariff in Westmorland Shopping Centre car park saving \u00a33.80 on the daily rate, and set a tariff of \u00a31.20 for all-day parking in a car park in Grange-over-Sands, saving \u00a34.50. Any surplus funds raised from off-street parking facilities after expenditure including car park maintenance and improvement, are used to offset the costs to the Council of providing services to the public, which would otherwise have to be met through Council Tax.\r\n\r\nFurther information about the council\u2019s car parks including location, number of parking bays, number of disabled parking spaces and charges can be found in the Car Parks in South Lakeland dataset.",
