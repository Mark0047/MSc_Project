These stations were defined as Environmental \nAssessment Reference Stations (EARS). Data is selected site monitoring, \ncontaining details of macrofauna found in each sample.\n\nThis data was part of a continuation of a time-series under a previous Defra \nproject (AO903) within the Isle of Wight and Cross Sands regions. Newly \nacquired and existing data from each of the three sampling locations has been \nanalysed independently following a standardised analytical approach and \nresults presented in three site-specific peer-reviewed publications.",
