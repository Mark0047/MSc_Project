                "description": "This publication combines data from the UK\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Inventory with data from a number of other sources, including local energy consumption statistics, to produce a nationally consistent set of carbon dioxide emissions estimates at local authority level from 2005 to 2014.\r\n\r\nThe data show emissions allocated on an \u201cend-user\u201d basis where emissions are distributed according to the point of energy consumption (or point of emission if not energy related). Except for the energy industry, emissions from the production of goods are assigned to where the production takes place. Therefore, emissions from the production of goods which are exported will be included, and emissions from the production of goods which are imported are excluded.\r\n\r\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is the main greenhouse gas, accounting for about 82 per cent of the UK greenhouse gas emissions in 2014. In recent years, increasing emphasis has been placed on the role of regional bodies and local government in contributing to energy efficiency improvements, and hence reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. The statistics are largely consistent with the UK national Greenhouse Gas Inventory and with the Devolved Administration Greenhouse Gas Inventories, but there are some minor methodological differences outlined in the methodology report",
