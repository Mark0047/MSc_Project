This core scan dataset was obtained using the Itrax XRF Scanner MC at the Core Scanning Facility (CSF) at the British Geological Survey (BGS), UK. It contains X-ray fluorescence (XRF) elemental data expressed as elemental counts or peak areas and optical images of each representative core stick. The dataset was created within the scope of the JET project (Integrated understanding of Early Jurassic Earth system and timescale) - https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=NE%2FN018508%2F1 This project has received funding from the International Continental Scientific Drilling Programme (ICDP) and the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).",
