F10 notifications remain in the database for 2 years from the project end date. Information held in the database is used to target HSE\u2019s inspection work and for research to understand the shape and nature of the industry.\nThe information held includes: Address of the construction site; Description of project type; Name and contact details for the CDM Co-ordinator, Principal Contractor and Client on the project; Name and contact details for any designers or other contractors on the project; Planned start date and duration of the project; Number of people and contractors at work on the site.
