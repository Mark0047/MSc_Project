        "notes": "In a collaborative Fisheries Science Partnership (FSP) Project, Chadfish \n(Cadgwith, Helford & District Fishermen\u2019s Society) and Cefas (Centre for \nEnvironment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science) sought to explore whether \nfishing with large mesh gill nets is a selective method which does not catch \nsmall fish; results in no discarding and no high grading; has low fuel use; \nand maximises the economic returns of the haddock fishery.\n\nFocusing on under 10 m gill nets in the south west of England, the project \nsourced and analysed extensive fisheries data sets, conducted interviews with \nskippers and organised a workshop of expert stakeholders including fishermen, \nscientists, policy makers and fisheries managers.\n\nThese activities were used to evaluate the impacts of large mesh gill nets \naccording to selectivity for target species, selectivity for size, impacts on \nunwanted by-catch species including mammals and birds, impacts on habitats and \neconomic returns from haddock.",
