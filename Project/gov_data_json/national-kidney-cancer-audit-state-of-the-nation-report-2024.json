        "notes": "The National Kidney Cancer Audit (NKCA) aims to evaluate the patterns of care and outcomes for people with kidney cancer in England and Wales, using routinely collected data and to support services to improve their care quality.\r\n\r\nThis State of the Nation report aims to help NHS organisations to benchmark their kidney cancer care against measurable standards, to identify unwarranted variation in measures of processes and outcomes, and to describe national levels and patterns of these measures in England and Wales.\r\n\r\nThe performance indicators include people diagnosed with kidney cancer between January 2017 to December 2021 in England using the National Cancer Registration Dataset (NCRD), and January 2022 to December 2022 in Wales. It reports on eight performance indicators for England and four for Wales outlined in the NKCA Quality Improvement Plan 2024. The report also describes the national picture and variation between NHS trusts in England/Health Boards in Wales. \r\n\r\nFor the national picture sections, we use the most recently available data in England from the Rapid Cancer Registration Dataset (RCRD) reporting on people diagnosed between 1st January 2019 and 30th September 2023, and in Wales between 1st January 2022 and 31st December 2022.",
