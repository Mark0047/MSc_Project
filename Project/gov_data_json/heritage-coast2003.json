        "notes": "This spatial dataset contains digitised boundaries of heritage coasts in Wales. Heritage Coasts occupy about a third of the Welsh coastline, that is 500 km (300 miles). These sites were set up to protect our coastlines from insensitive developments. Most are defined simply by the coastline between two named points, however some have clearly defined inland boundaries. Their status carries no legal protection, but planning authorities must take the designation into account when making decisions on development. Management of Heritage Coasts is the remit of the local authority and is generally carried out by Heritage Coast Officers with some practical tasks done by volunteers. Most of the Heritage coastal strips were defined in 1973, 1974 and one in 1984. The descriptions and paper maps\nassociated with this dataset are the legal documents.",
