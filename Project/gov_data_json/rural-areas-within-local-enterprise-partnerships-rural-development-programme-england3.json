        "notes": "Rural areas within Local Enterprise Partnership boundaries (an interpretation by Defra given available information) and Built-Up Area geographies from the Office for National Statistics. \nThis geography is best used in combination with the Local Enterprise Partnership boundaries geography. Boundaries will exclude built-up areas with populations over 10,000 (these will be identified as \"No Features found\"). Similarly some unpopulated built-up sites are excluded. Some settlements (with populations between 10,000 and 30,000) have been designated as hub towns potentially serving their wider rural area, and as such will be included in the boundaries. The rural areas shown are those which may be eligible for Rural Development Programme funding. This does not guarantee eligibility and any potential application should be discussed with the relevant Local Enterprise Partnership in the first instance. Some unpopulated built-up sites are shown separately and eligibility will need to be discussed with the Local Enterprise Partnership within which the site is situated. \u2022\tThe boundaries have been updated to reflect a merger of Northamptonshire Enterprise Partnership and South East Midlands Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) (29/06/2018). Further boundary updates reflect the overlapping border area between Greater Cambridge and Greater Peterborough LEP and New Anglia LEP being assigned solely to New Anglia LEP. Also, the New Forest local authority now forms part of Solent LEP having previously been part of Enterprise M3 LEP (14/10/2019). This is a placeholder with the actual data being published shortly and publicly available in November 2019.",
