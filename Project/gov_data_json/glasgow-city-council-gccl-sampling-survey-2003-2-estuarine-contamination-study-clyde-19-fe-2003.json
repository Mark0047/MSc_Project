        "notes": "This marine sampling survey took place in February 2003 in the Firth of Clyde on board the Endrick 2. The survey formed part of an estuarine contamination study, looking at the geophysics, geochemistry and engineering properties of sediment and water samples of the Inner Clyde Estuary. The work was undertaken under a co-funding arrangement between the British Geological Survey (BGS) and Glasgow City Council. Ship time was provided by Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and small boat facilities by the Glasgow Humane Society. 14 grab and gravity core sediment samples were collected by BGS. Details of the study are contained in BGS Commercial Report CR/04/057R.",
