        "notes": "Scotland coastlines and waters are a special place for marine habitats and wildlife. The Community-led Marine Biodiversity Monitoring Project encourages everyone to get involved in the survey and monitoring of marine life in their local waters. Through this project we are working directly to increase participation in marine biodiversity surveying in Scotland. This includes working to improve survey skills and increase the knowledge base within communities, providing access to suitable equipment, and supporting community-led survey planning, fieldwork and data management.\n     A Community-led Marine Biodiversity Monitoring Handbook was co-created as part of the project. Most communities collecting data follow the Handbook survey methods and use the corresponding recording forms. Community data are validated and verified according to the project data journey and supporting guidance. \n     The Community-led Marine Biodiversity Monitoring Project is a partnership between communities and groups across Scotland, NatureScot and Fauna and Flora International, funded by the William Grant Foundation.",
