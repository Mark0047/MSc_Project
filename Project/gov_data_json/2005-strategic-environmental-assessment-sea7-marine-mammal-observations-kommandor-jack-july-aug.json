Marine mammal observations were carried out daily, over a 28 day period in July and August 2005, as part of a geophysical survey on  MV Kommandor Jack for the Department of Trade and Industry's (now Department of Energy and Climate Change) Strategic Environmental Assessment SEA7 west of Scotland. This report describes exactly how and where the marine mammal observations were made. It also presents and summarises the 40 sightings that were made during the course of the survey.",
