Also included are the eight predictor \nvariables that were used to model sediment grain size. These were: Bathymetry, \nBathymetric position index at a 50-pixel radii, Bathymetric position index at \na 434-pixel radii, Distance from coast, Current speed at the seabed, Wave peak \norbital velocity at the seabed, and suspended inorganic particulate matter for \nsummer and winter as two separate variables.",
