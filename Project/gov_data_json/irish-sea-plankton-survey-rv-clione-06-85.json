Plankton samples were \ncollected at each site on a planned survey grid. In addition to Nephrops \nlarvae, fish eggs and larvae were also analysed. The data described here \nconsists of the numbers of Nephrops larvae and fish eggs and larvae identified \nfrom the main net samples collected on the survey in May 1985, along with \nassociated positional and ancillary data and volumes filtered.",
