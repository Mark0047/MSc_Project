        "notes": "Monitor is publishing the information from the 2012/13 Foundation Trust Consolidation (FTC) files submitted to Monitor by NHS foundation trusts on 30 May 2013.\r\n\r\n* What is being published\r\n\r\nThe FTC files contain an NHS foundation trust's accounts data, together with other information to aid Monitor\u2019s consolidation of the accounts, and additional information required by Monitor or the Department of Health.\r\n\r\nThe data set published here is limited to the FTC information that NHS foundation trusts are required to include in their annual accounts. The information contained in this file is already available in individual NHS foundation trusts' annual reports as laid before Parliament and published by Monitor in the FT Directory on Monitor\u2019s website. The intention of this data file is to make this data easier to locate and manipulate.\r\n\r\nThis file does not contain consolidation adjustments made by Monitor. Upon consolidation Monitor makes adjustments including eliminating income and expenditure between NHS foundation trusts. For this reason the totals of the data included in this file might not agree to Monitor\u2019s Consolidated NHS Foundation Trust Accounts.\r\n\r\n* How to use the data \r\n\r\nTwo files have been published, which should be used in conjunction:\r\n\r\n- the data file, containing all of the FTC data published in the accounts of the 145 NHS foundation trusts as at 31 March 2013; and\r\n- an illustrative FTC file to assist the user in understanding the data being presented.\r\n\r\nThe data set is a large file which contains tables of accounts data, for all notes to the accounts, for multiple NHS foundation trusts. It is difficult to present this data in a better format given the multi-dimensional nature of the data and limitations on file size. To assist the user in manipulating this data, please refer to the instructions document for further guidance. ",
