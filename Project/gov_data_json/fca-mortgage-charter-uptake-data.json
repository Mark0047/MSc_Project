There are 49 signatories, representing around 90% of the mortgage market.\r\n\r\n##These commitments include:\r\n\r\n* not to force a borrower to leave their home without their consent, unless in exceptional circumstances, in less than a year from their first missed payment\r\n \r\n* to allow customers to lock in a new deal up to 6 months ahead of the end of a fixed rate deal, and to request a better like-for-like deal up until the new one starts, if one is available\r\n \r\n* without assessing affordability, to permit customers who are up to date with their payments to switch to interest-only payments for 6 months, or to extend their mortgage term with the option to revert to their original term within 6 months",
