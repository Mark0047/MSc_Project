The UWWTR regulates the collection and treatment of waste water from homes and from industry. In the UK, the Directive is implemented through the Urban Wastewater Treatment Regulations 1994. Under these Regulations, water bodies that are (or may soon become) eutrophic should be designated as sensitive areas by Defra. This applies to still fresh waters, rivers, estuaries and coastal waters.\n    ",
