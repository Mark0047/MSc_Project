This dataset details the infauna present at \neach sampling station.\n\nAt each location, five sediment samples for macrofaunal analysis were \ncollected using a 0.1m2 Day grab from the central point of a 500 m grid of \n9 stations, the latter being sampled for contaminant analyses only. The five \nreplicates were collected from within a 100 m range ring, using SEXTANT \nsoftware and DGPS position-fixing.",
