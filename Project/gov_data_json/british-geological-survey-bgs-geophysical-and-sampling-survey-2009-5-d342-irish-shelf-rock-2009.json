        "notes": "This British Geological Survey (BGS) geophysical and sampling survey took place in August/September 2009, on the Irish Shelf and Rockall / Hatton area on board the RRS Discovery. The objectives were to carry out 16 site surveys in Irish and UK waters, investigating ground conditions for sites of proposed shallow drilling. Regional geophysical surveys of Anton Dohrn Seamount and George Bligh Bank were carried out, as were 3 gravity / magnetic transects across the Rockall Trough and one transect across the Hatton Rockall Basin. Sea floor data were collected using a gravity corer and box corer. Geophysical data were gathered by BGS using airgun, sparker gravity meter, and magnetometer. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS Internal Report IR/09/075. GeoIndex Offshore - https://mapapps2.bgs.ac.uk/geoindex_offshore/home.html?cruise=2009/5&.",
