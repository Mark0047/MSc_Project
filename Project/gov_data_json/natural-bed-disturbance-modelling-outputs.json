Disturbance was taken \nto mean physical movement of the seedbed sediments and was quantified as a \ndisturbance frequency (days per year disturbance occurred). For sandy regions \nthe disturbance depth is also predicted (days per year disturbance occurred to \na given depth below the seabed). For gravel and mud substrates the depth of \ndisturbance was left unquantified. Format: Zipped ASCII (space delimited) \nfiles covering the period 2000-2008 inclusive.",
