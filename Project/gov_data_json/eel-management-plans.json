The Environment Agency has produced 11 EMPs, covering each of the 11 River Basin Districts in England and Wales. Each plan addresses the causes of decline in eel populations and identifies management actions which are achievable. The measures addressed in the 11 EMPs fall into five broad groups: improving eel passage; Barriers to migration, Monitoring, Access to habitat, Stocking, and Regulating eel Fishing. ",
