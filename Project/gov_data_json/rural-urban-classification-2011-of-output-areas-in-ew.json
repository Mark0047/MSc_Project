The product was sponsored by a cross-Government working group comprising Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Department for Communities and Local Government, Office for National Statistics and the Welsh Government. OAs are treated as \u2018urban\u2019 if they were allocated to a 2011 built-up area with a population of 10,000 or more. The urban domain is then further sub-divided into three broad morphological types based on the predominant settlement component. As with the previous version of the classification, the remaining \u2018rural\u2019 OAs are grouped into three broad morphological types based on the predominant settlement component. The classification also categorises OAs based on context \u2013 i.e. whether the wider surrounding area of a given OA is sparsely populated or less sparsely populated.</span>",
