The information is taken from data collated for the 2010 Secondary School Performance Tables, which is currently in the process of being checked by schools. The results shown in this SFR are based on pupils reaching the end of Key Stage 4, typically those starting the academic year aged 15.\r\nAccredited iGCSEs are included in the figures for the first time this year as equivalent to GCSEs and have been counted towards the English and mathematics indicators.\r\nThe SFR includes national figures and local authority figures. \r\nRevised figures will be published in January 2011 accounting for amendments made by schools up until the publication of the Achievement and  Attainment Tables.",
