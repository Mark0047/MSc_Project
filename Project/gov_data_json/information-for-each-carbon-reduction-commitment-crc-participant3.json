        "notes": "The CRC Order 2013 provides for publication of information on the basis of participants' annual reports plus details submitted when they registered for the scheme.\nThe CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme (CRC) is a mandatory scheme which aims to improve energy efficiency and cut emissions for large public and private sector energy users across the UK.  The scheme aims to encourage organisations to develop energy management strategies that promote a better understanding of energy usage, and lead to improved energy efficiency.\nThe scheme is split into phases: Phase 1 from 1 April 2010 until 31 March 2014 and Phase 2 from 1 April 2014  until 31 March 2019. Each year, CRC participants have to monitor their energy consumption and report this information into the CRC Registry, an online IT system, which calculates their carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Participants must purchase and surrender 'allowances' to cover these emissions - one allowance for each tonne of CO2. Further information on the scheme can be found on the CRC pages of GOV.UK.\nThe ARP format was introduced for the 2012 to 2013 reporting year and replaces the performance league tables (PLT). Removal of the PLT was part of the government\u2019s simplification of the CRC scheme.\nThese annually produced data sets contain the information provided by participants to the CRC Registry including organisational type, energy use and CO2 emissions. The data should be read in combination with the equivalent years \u2018CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme: annual report publication which are located on GOV.UK. \nCRC performance league tables were published for the 2010 to 2011 and 2011 to 2012 compliance years and ranked participants according to their energy efficiency performance against a range of metrics.
