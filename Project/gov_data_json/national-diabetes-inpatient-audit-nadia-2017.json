        "notes": "Making clinical audit data transparent \r\n\r\nIn his transparency and open data letter to Cabinet Ministers on 7 July 2011, the Prime Minister made a commitment to make clinical audit data available from the national audits within the National Clinical Audit and Patient Outcomes Programme. \r\n\r\nThe information available from this webpage comes from the National Diabetes Inpatient Audit. The National Diabetes Inpatient Audit is a snapshot audit of diabetes inpatient care. In September 2017 the National Diabetes Inpatient Audit was conducted in hospitals across England and Wales, collecting data on characteristics of the hospital including staffing structures, patient clinical data and patient experience information. \r\n\r\nWhat information is being made available? \r\n\r\n\uf0a7 Audit participation and data completeness for the key fields \r\n\r\n\uf0a7 Measures about the process of care given to patients \r\n\r\n\uf0a7 Information about care outcomes and treatment. \r\n\r\nThese data do not list individual patient information nor do they contain any patient identifiable data. \r\n\r\nUsing and interpreting the data \r\n\r\nData from the National Diabetes Inpatient Audit should not be looked at in isolation when assessing standards of care. \r\n\r\nAccessing the data \r\n\r\nThe data are being made available on the data.gov website. Each year a data file from the National Diabetes Inpatient Audit will be made available in CSV format. Hospitals are identified by name and their national code. \r\n\r\nWhat does the data cover? \r\n\r\nThe audit looks at the following areas: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Did diabetes management minimise the risk of avoidable complications? \r\n\r\n\u2022 Did harm result from the inpatient stay? \r\n\r\n\u2022 Was patient experience of the inpatient stay favourable? \r\n\r\n\u2022 Has the quality of care and patient feedback changed? \r\n\r\nWhat period does the data cover? \r\n\r\nThis data covers patients surveyed on a date between 25 and 29 September 2017. The audit report was published on 14 March 2018. Historic data is available for previous audit years (2010-2013, 2015-2016) where survey questions were comparable.",

HQIP is an independent organisation led by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, The Royal College of Nursing, and National Voices and it works in partnership with patients and healthcare professionals to influence and improve healthcare practice at all levels. \r\n\r\nHQIP commissions, manages, supports, and promotes national and local programmes of quality improvement. This includes the national clinical audit programmes, the Clinical Outcome Review Programmes and the National Joint Registry on behalf of NHS England and other healthcare departments and organisations.  \r\n\r\nIn compliance with its commissioning status, HQIP:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Uses best management and procurement practice to ensure robust results and actionable recommendations.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Ensures patients and carers remain at the heart of its work through continued, strategic involvement in all relevant processes and projects.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Supports professionals to review and improve their practice by providing education and training programmes, and opportunities to share best practice as part of promoting an integrated approach to quality improvement.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Works to inform and influence national healthcare policy by effectively communicating its work and that of its partners.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Encourages wide use of robust data for quality improvement of care, offering patient choice, promoting patient safety, supporting revalidation and service accreditation, commissioning, service redesign, and research.\r\n\r\nFurther information about the HQIP Board, the team, and the organisations that HQIP work with is available on the HQIP website at http://www.hqip.org.uk/about-us/.",
