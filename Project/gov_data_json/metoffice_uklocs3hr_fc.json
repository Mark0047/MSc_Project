It should be noted that sites will only report parameters based on the instrumentation installed at each site and we only make available those parameters published on the Met Office website. Observations are subject to final quality control by the Met Office after publication by data.gov.uk, any changes made will not be retrospectively applied to this dataset.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor's Autumn Statement 2011 announced that this release is open (OGL) and unrestricted (bulk download API):\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61959/Further_detail_on_Open_Data_measures_in_the_Autumn_Statement_2011.pdf\r\nwhich is different to the access provided by the Met Office directly.",
