        "notes": "The objective of this project was to assess and estimate the survivability of \nsole caught in the Solent (ICES Subarea VIId) inshore otter trawl fishery. \nThis project follows a previous study of the east coast (ICES Subarea IVc) \ninshore otter trawl fishery and was designed to improve the confidence in a \nfishery wide estimate of sole survival in inshore trawling. There is a strong \nperception from the fishing industry that sole has a high survival rate in \nthis fishery and, where sole quotas are restricted, landing undersized sole \ncould potentially risk a premature end to the fishing season. Under the \nlanding obligation, all sole (*Solea solea*) catches must be landed unless \nan exemption, based on scientific evidence demonstrating high survival, is \nawarded.",
