        "notes": "Wessex Archaeology was commissioned by Historic Scotland to undertake an Undesignated Site Assessment of the site known as the Tobermory Galleon in Tobermory Bay, Mull. The work was undertaken as part of the Contract for Archaeological Services in Relation to the Protection of Wrecks Act (1973). The assessment was carried out in advance of possible further commercial salvage work on the site. Wessex Archaeology conducted a geophysical survey at three sites within Tobermoray Harbour on the 23rd August 2006. The survey was conducted from the S/V Xplorer. A geophysical survey was followed by diver ground-truthing of anomalies was carried out to confirm the position, extent, stability and character of any significant archaeological deposits. The survey showed that part of the wreck and debris fields from both the sinking and subsequent salvage may still exist although the precise nature, extent and position of archaeological deposits associated with the wreck, in particular any surviving coherent ship structure, remained unclear. The survey included single beam echosounder, sub-bottom profiler and sidescan sonar. The geology and geophysics component of the data are archived at British Geological Survey (BGS) MEDIN Data Archive Centre (DAC) for Geology and Geophysics. Data were also provided to other archive centres as appropriate.",
