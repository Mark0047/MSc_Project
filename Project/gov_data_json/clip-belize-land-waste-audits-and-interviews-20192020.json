Household waste audits were conducted in eight \ncommunities between May and June 2019 in Belize (Belmopan, Mahogany Heights, \nDangriga, Corozal, Belize City, Orange Walk, Bullet Tree Falls in Cayo, and \nToledo rural). Commercial activities were also audited in five locations \n(Belmopan, Belize City, Corozal, Dangriga and Punta Gorda). A total of 268 \nhouseholds and 64 commercial activities were audited. Also, 12 samples were \ncollected in Belize City to analyse the litter swiped from streets by city \ncouncil contractors.
