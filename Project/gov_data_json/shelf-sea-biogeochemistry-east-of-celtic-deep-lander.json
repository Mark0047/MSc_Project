The \nmooring consists of a 3 legged stainless steel \"minilander\" 1.5 meters high. \nThe biogeochemical sensors are mounted at 1 meter above the seabed. \nTemperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll fluorescence, turbidity \nwhere fitted to a Cefas ESM2 data logger. These instruments gathered data for \n5 minutes every 30 minutes. Sensors were validated against in-situ samples \nduring deployment and recovery. Fluorometers were standardised using \nfluorosphere beads. Turbidity meters were calibrated using Stabical (Hach, \nUS). These moorings were also fitted with upward facing acoustic Doppler \ncurrent profilers (ADCP), this data is held by BODC.",
