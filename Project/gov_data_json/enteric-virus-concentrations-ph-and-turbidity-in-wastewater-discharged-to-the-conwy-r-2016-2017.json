        "notes": "This dataset contains pH, turbidity and viral concentration information in untreated and treated wastewater samples at wastewater discharge points and wastewater treatment plants along the Conwy River. The aim of the data collection was to investigate diurnal changes in enteric virus concentrations in wastewater and to investigate any correlation with wastewater pH and turbidity. Untreated wastewater samples were collected at one wastewater treatment plant for two events. Treated wastewater samples were collected at two wastewater discharge points for two and three sampling events, respectively. All the sampling took place between July 2016 and March 2017. During a sampling events, samples were collected every two hours for 72 hours using autosamplers. Samples were collected by trained members of staff from Bangor University and Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH). The data were collected as part of the VIRAQUA project was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under the Environmental Microbiology and Human Health (EMHH) Programme (NE/M010996/1).
