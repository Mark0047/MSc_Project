        "notes": "This dataset contains the results of electric vehicle trials that were\u00a0funded by the Mayor of London and delivered by Gnewt Cargo in partnership with the University of Westminster.\n\nThe Agile Urban Logistics project was delivered under the Mayor\u2019s Smart London Demonstrator programme. The aim was to trial innovative solutions for the light freight sector that allows it to adapt to changing regulatory and market conditions, mitigating congestion and emissions impacts. The three trials were:\n\n**Agile 1:** Multi-carrier consolidation trial\n\nIn the Agile Gnewt Cargo trial, the demonstrator carried parcels for final delivery in central London for several major parcels businesses (namely Hermes, TNT and DX, all of which are active in business-to-consumer (B2C), home deliveries, and business-to-business (B2B) operations in London and the UK). The area covered focuses around the London Congestion charge area with a keen focus on the west side of this highly polluted region.\n\n**Agile 2:** IT solutions for parcel deliveries trial\n\nThe trial was designed to test a range of IT solutions for electric fleet management, improving efficient client communication management and routing and planning systems.\u00a0\n\n**Agile 3:** Single-carrier consolidation trial\n\nThe trial explored scenarios for consolidating deliveries of multiple retail and non- retail clients using a single carrier (Gnewt Cargo) in a single van. All deliveries were done using electric vans. The aim of the trial was to reduce the number of delivery trips, reduce congestion and improve air quality outputs compared to a diesel equivalent approach by utilizing zero emissions electric freight delivery vehicles.\n\nFor each trial there is a Final Report, a Data Report and a spreadsheet containing the raw data used in the reports.",
