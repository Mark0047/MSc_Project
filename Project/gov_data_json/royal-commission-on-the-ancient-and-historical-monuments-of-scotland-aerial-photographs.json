The aerial photos bought by BGS were taken during a two year period from 1988-89 and were bought by BGS for individual mapping projects. The photos are a copy of the originals held by the RCAHMS. Since 1976, RCAHMS has undertaken an annual programme of aerial survey, recording archaeological sites, monuments and buildings throughout Scotland. All RCAHMS data is crown copyright. The photos are for internal BGS use but external users are welcome to view them at BGS, an appointment must be made first. An index is provided on the Geoscience Data Index (GDI).",
