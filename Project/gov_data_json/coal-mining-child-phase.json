It deals with mine water pollution and other mining legacy issues. It also owns, on behalf of the country, the majority of the coal in Britain, and licenses coal mining. \r\n\r\nWe use our skills to provide services to other government departments and agencies, local governments and commercial partners. We contribute to the delivery of the UK Government\u2019s Industrial Strategy and the environmental, social and economic priorities of the UK, Scottish and Welsh Governments. \r\nBy sharing our knowledge and expertise we support them, and our partners, to create cleaner, greener nations for us all.\r\n\r\nThe Coal Authority is an executive non-departmental public body, sponsored by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/coalauthority\r\n",
