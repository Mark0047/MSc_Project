See: https://environment.data.gov.uk/dataset/ce876669-106a-473c-82f4-5f7ff2a25dac\n\nA water company\u2019s water resources management plan (WRMP) is supported by a series of data tables. During the consultation on their plans the company produce draft water resource management plan tables (dWRMP tables). These Tables are used to help regulators, water company customers and other organisations understand and appraise the plan.\n\nThe following data has been extracted from the water company revised draft Water Resources Management Plans for 2019 (rdWRMP19). The data is at Water Company level, where a company has more than one Water Resource Zone the Tables have been combined to produce a Water Company Level data set. Due to the need to provide a consistent data set, the values in this data set may differ slightly from that in the company revised draft WRMP Tables, consequently, any analysis should be checked against the rdWRMP19 Tables available from the water companies. \n\nThis workbook displays WRMP data from 2020/21 to 2044/45 for all water companies \u2013 this is the statutory minimum period that companies should plan for, and all water companies have submitted data for these years within this workbook. Some companies have chosen to present additional supply and demand data for years between 2044/45 and 2079/80 to demonstrate longer term planning and forecasts. This is not a requirement of the WRMP process and optional, and has been provided for transparency purposes. Data provided between 2044/45 and 2079/80 should be viewed for information purposes only, and should not be used in isolation to assess supply and demand in these years as the dataset is incomplete.\n\nThis data set, as the revised draft, supersedes the Draft Water Resources Management Plan 2019 Supply-Demand Data at Company Level 2020/21 to 2044/45.
