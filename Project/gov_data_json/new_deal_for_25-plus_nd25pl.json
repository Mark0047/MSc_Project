It is a mandatory programme for those who had been claiming JSA for at least 2 years. Those who had already been unemployed for 2 years when the programme was introduced were required to enter New Deal when they reached their next annual Restart interview date, but were entitled to request immediate entry. From April 2001, the programme was extended and enhanced to provide clients with access to a greater and more tailored range of support and provision. Eligibility was extended to include those who had been claiming JSA for 18 out of the last 21 months.",
