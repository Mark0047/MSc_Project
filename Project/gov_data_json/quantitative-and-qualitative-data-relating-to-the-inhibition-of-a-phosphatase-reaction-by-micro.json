        "notes": "[This dataset is embargoed until October 28, 2025]. This dataset contains information about the development of a paper analytical device for the detection of the microcystin toxin. Water samples were collected weekly from Rostherne Mere and Tatton Park Lake, Cheshire between 20/07/2022 and 12/10/2022. Samples were analysed for the presence of microcystin-producing genes and released microcystin. A paper analytical device incorporating a protein phosphatase inhibition assay was also used to monitor microcystin levels. Preliminary user evaluation of the paper analytical devices and associated mobile photo applications is also provided. The work was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council (Grant NE/X011607/1). Full details about this dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5285/5fe25b28-f10b-467b-8812-0b1ee6fd7491",
