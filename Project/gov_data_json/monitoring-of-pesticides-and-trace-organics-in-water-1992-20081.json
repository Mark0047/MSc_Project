This is a standalone dataset for 1992 to 2008 and there have been no updates to the data since its original publication. These data are available on request. \n\nThis record is for Approval for Access product AfA197. A pesticide is defined under the Food and Environment Protection Act (1985) as \u201cany substance, preparation or organism prepared or used for destroying any pest\u201d. Pesticides include herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, molluscicides, rodenticides, growth regulators and masonry and timber preservatives. They are not confined to agriculture, but are also used on roads and rail tracks, in homes and gardens, as sheep dips, for the protection of public health, and for many other purposes.\nThe Agency\u2019s monitoring for pesticides is guided by statutory requirements to monitor concentrations of specific pesticides listed in certain Directives. We also undertake non-statutory monitoring of pesticides, when investigating known or predicted local problems and pollution incidents.\nTrace Organics are organic compounds (including pesticides) detectable at low levels. As with pesticides, our monitoring of these substances is guided by statutory requirements.\nThe dataset contains information on all pesticides and trace organics monitored by the Environment Agency. Monitoring frequency varies between sites and years. Monitoring covers fresh and saline surface waters, groundwater, discharges, sediments and biota. Please note: Limits of detection vary between laboratories. The data is extracted from the Environment Agency\u2019s Water Information Management System (WIMS).\nData is available for monitoring between 1992 and 2008. The dataset holds each year\u2019s pesticides and trace organics monitoring data. Some sites are identified as being monitored for known or suspected contamination issues, so that they can be excluded for analysis of background levels. The layout of fields and tables varies from year to year.\nINFORMATION WARNING\nWhere this dataset indicates that a sample was taken in connection with a pollution incident or potential legal proceedings no inference should be drawn that landowners in the immediate vicinity of the sampling site had any responsibility.\nAttribution Statement: \u00a9 Environment Agency copyright and/or database right 2015.
