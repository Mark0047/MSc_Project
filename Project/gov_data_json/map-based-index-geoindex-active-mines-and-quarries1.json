        "notes": "This layer of the map based index (GeoIndex) shows the location and name of active mineral workings in the UK and is derived from the BGS BritPits (British Pits) database. The BritPits database of onshore mineral workings in the UK is based on the records of the BGS, the Coal Authority, industry sources and the Valuation Office Agency (Minerals) and is maintained by the BGS Onshore Minerals and Energy Resources Programme. The database describes individual workings, both currently active and formerly worked, in terms of name, location (including Mineral Planning Authority), ownership, basic geology, commodity produced and end-uses. Contact details including the operator name, address, postcode and telephone and fax numbers are held where known. The location of over 6000 workings are held, with about 2000 currently being worked. The data can be produced digitally, under licence, in formats to meet customer requirements, such as locations of workings or operator addresses, and is suitable for use in GIS applications using the British National Grid. Although the GeoIndex is updated at regular intervals more information may be available than is shown at any one time.",
