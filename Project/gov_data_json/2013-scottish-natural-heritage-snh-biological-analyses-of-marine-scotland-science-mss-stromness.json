        "notes": "The purpose of this benthic survey (cruise 0713A) at Stromness was to improve knowledge of the occurrence and distribution of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance, particularly priority marine features (PMFs). This site was of interest because the area is a spoil ground, locatedwest of Stromness, Orkney. An underwater video survey were conducted by MSS for MSS on the 1st June 2013 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 1 site. Analyses on the images, commissioned by SNH, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. MSS used the vessel FRV Alba na Mara for this survey.",
