        "notes": "\n      Priority Ecological Networks (PENs) in the terrestrial environment are versions of the all-Wales habitat networks that show areas of connectivity between Protected Sites, and as such provide a framework to inform the location of action to build functional resilient ecological networks based on our most important places for biodiversity.  Typical actions would be habitat improvement, restoration, or creation, located within the boundaries of a PEN, or situated at its margins to consolidate, extend, or link different PENs. These PENs supersede the GIS layers that were previously known as \u2018Level 2 networks\u2019, and are available for: Native woodland; Semi-natural grassland; Heathland; Bog; Fen and Sand Dune. All these priority networks are also represented as a \u2018PEN Ho\ntspot\u2019 map, which is a simple count of all available networks within a given 1km square for an \u2018at a glance\u2019 view across Wales.\n\nIn addition, the \u2018native woodland\u2019 and \u2018semi-natural grassland\u2019 PENs have both received updates in the form of additional networks to  accommodate our latest protected sites series and survey information and expand beyond what was originally available. Heathland, Bog and Fen have been merged from their originally separate upland and lowland versions into singular datasets and a previously unreleased \u2018sand dune\u2019 network is also now included.  A Freshwater PEN is planned.\nAt sea, an ecologically coherent network of marine protected areas (MPAs) has been established which, when measures are in place to bring about good condition, will form the marine Resilient Ecological Network. Connectivity within the MPA Network is inherently good, however some of the features (species and habitats for which the sites are designated) are known to be in unfavourable condition. The marine Priority Ecological Network (MPEN) map shows the full extent of the MPA network, highlighting the sites where one or more features are known to be in unfavourable condition. In the highlighted areas, action is needed to deliver measures that restore features, reduce pressures to enable their recovery, or gather evidence needed to support effective management.\n    ",
