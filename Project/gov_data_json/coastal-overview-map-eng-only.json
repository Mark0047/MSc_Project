        "notes": "The Coastal Overview data layers identifies the lead authority for the management of discrete stretches of the English coast as defined by the Seaward of the Schedule 4 boundary of the Coastal Protection Act 1949.  The data are intended as a reference for GIS users and Coastal Engineers with GIS capability to identify the responsible authority or whether the coast is privately owned. The information has been assigned from the following sources, listed in by preference:\nShoreline Management Plans 1; Environment Agency\u2019s RACE database; Consultation with Coastal Business User Group and Local Authority Maritime records where possible.  A confidence rating is attributed based on where the data has been attributed from and the entry derived from the source data.\nThe following data is intended as a reference document for GIS users and Coastal Engineers with GIS capability to identify the responsible authority and the assigned EA Coastal Engineer so as to effectively manage the coast for erosion and flooding.  The product comprises 3 GIS layers that are based on the OS MasterMap Mean High Watermark and consists of the following data layers that are intended to be displayed as with the confidence factor that the information is correct. Coastal Overview Map [Polyline] \u2013details the Lead Authority, EA Contact and other overview information for coast sections; Coastal Overview Map [Point] \u2013 shows the start point of the discrete stretch of coast and the lead authority; and Coastal Legislative Layer [Polyline] - represents the predominant risk; flooding or erosion, which are assigned to each section of the coastline.
