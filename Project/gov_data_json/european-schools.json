These schools provide an education for the children of parents working in the EU institutions for example, the European Commission. The employment of such teachers meet the UK Government's obligations under the terms of a 1957 inter governmental treaty, the Convention Defining the Statute of the European Schools. The Department employs 179 teachers in the European Schools as of September 2013.  A database is used to store teachers' personal information, along with other details, for example, the start and end dates of their employment contract and information about their salary. The database is updated frequently when personal details change and at the end and start of each academic year as teachers leave and new ones join.",
