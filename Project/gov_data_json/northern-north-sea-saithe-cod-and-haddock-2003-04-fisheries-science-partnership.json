The project used two trips of a commercial stern \ntrawler, the FV Farnella between 18 September and 5 October. The work plan \ninvolved otter trawling under dispensation from the quota regulations on \ngrounds chosen by the vessel skippers in consultation with CEFAS.\n\nTotal catches of all saithe, cod, and haddock were weighed and classified as \n'discarded' or 'retained' according to advice from the fishing crew. Samples \nof these species from most hauls were also measured individually to obtain \nlength frequency distributions. Otoliths were collected from 382 saithe and 22 \ncod.",
