The most recent census took place in March of 2021.</p><p>The census asks every household questions about the people who live there and the type of home they live in. In doing so, it helps to build a detailed snapshot of society. Information from the census helps the government and local authorities to plan and fund local services, such as education, doctors' surgeries and roads.<br/></p><p>Key census statistics for Leicester are published on the open data platform to make information accessible to local services, voluntary and community groups, and residents.<br/></p><p>Further information about the census and full datasets can be found on the ONS website - <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/aboutcensus/censusproducts\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/aboutcensus/censusproducts</a></p><p><b>Religion</b></p><p>This dataset provides Census 2021 estimates that classify usual residents in England and Wales by religion.
