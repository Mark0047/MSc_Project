        "notes": "This dataset provides data on automated high resolution soil respiration measurements as micromoles of Carbon dioxide per square metre per second. Automated high resolution soil measurements were carried out in campaigns in 2013 and 2014. Campaigns were carried out monthly between June and October 2013 and in June and August 2014 capturing the plants growing season. Data were collected from the climate change field site, Climoor, that is located in the Clocaenog forest, North East Wales. The experimental field site consists of three untreated control plots three plots where the plant canopy air is artificially warmed during night time hours and three plots where rainfall is excluded from the plots at least during the plants growing season (March to September). Measurements were taken with automated soil respiration chambers. The Climoor field experiment intends to answer questions regarding the effects of warming and drought on ecosystem processes. Plot level soil respiration measurements are important to investigate soil carbon dynamics and changes in soil carbon cycling and storage under the imposed climatic treatments. Soil respiration measurements were carried out by trained CEH Bangor members of staff. Full details about this dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5285/dcfc2081-f42c-4238-93dd-2ce64438b3ea",
