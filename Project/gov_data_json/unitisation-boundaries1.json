This dataset contains the boundaries of these units and includes information such as designation type, unit name, unit area, national grid reference and former Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) regions. Digitising began in 2007 and is on going as and when new sites are created or existing sites are altered. The purpose of these management units is to have a coherent plan in order to manage sites in a practical manner to ensure that work is done to get sites and their corresponding features into a favourable condition, as per the requirements of t\nhe protected sites.\n\n    ",
