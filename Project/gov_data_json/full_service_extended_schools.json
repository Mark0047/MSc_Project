        "notes": "An extended school is likely to be open to pupils, families and the wider community throughout the school day, before and after school hours, at weekends and during school holidays. The services offered by the school might include childcare and learning and recreational activities for all members of the community. Extended schools recognise the need to work in partnership with other agencies (such as health and social care) to help children and young people achieve their potential. Schools that recognise the need to find the best way to help an individual pupil to learn will want to look at both the pupil's learning needs and at overcoming barriers to learning that may come from outside the school. Having easier access to multi - disciplinary teams can support pupils and teachers. Pupils can benefit through early support so that these problems do not get in the way of their learning, and teachers are able to concentrate on teaching.\r\nSource: Department for Education and Skills (DfES)\r\nPublisher: Department for Children Schools and Families (DCSF)\r\nGeographies: Local Authority District (LAD), County/Unitary Authority, Government Office Region (GOR), National\r\nGeographic coverage: England\r\nTime coverage: 1997, 2005\r\nType of data: Administrative data",
