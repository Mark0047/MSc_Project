        "notes": "These files include hydrochemical data and groundwater level time series for a number of boreholes and wells within the basement aquifers of the Romwe catchment. For each borehole/well there are associated depth, geology and use data. A time series study of abstraction was also carried out for a subset of wells. Time series rainfall data for a rain gauge in the catchment is also included. These data were collected through a series of projects: Small scale irrigation using collector wells: pilot project (CEH/BGS/Zimbabwe Ministry of Lands, Agriculture and Water Development; DfID funded) Sustainability of yield from wells and boreholes in hard rock aquifers (BGS; DfID funded) Regional groundwater recharge assessment in semi-arid areas (CEH/BGS; DfID-funded) The Hydrology of a dry land catchment in southern Zimbabwe, and the effects of climatic and land use change on shallow groundwater resources (PhD project, Uni. Reading/CEH) Integrated Catchment Management and Sustainable Water Resource Development in Semi-arid Zimbabwe (PhD project, Uni. Reading/CEH) Note: CEH (Center of Ecology and Hydrology) was known as \u2018IH\u2019 during the period of the study",
