The data is ordered chronologically in an excel spreadsheet and each sample is given a \u2018Sample ID\u2019, \u2018Lithology\u2019, \u2018Locality\u2019, \u2018Age\u2019 and \u2018Date analysed\u2019, followed by whole rock and sediment values for the following elements; Ag, Al, As, Au, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Ca, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Ga, Ge, Hf, Hg, In, K, La, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nb, Ni, P, Pb, Pd, Pt, Rb, Re, S, Sb, Sc, Se, Sn, Sr, Ta, Te, Th, Ti, TI, U, V, W, Y, Zn, Zr. Cells which are highlighted orange signify that the value given was below the detection limit. The values in orange cells have been halved to maintain spreadsheet functionality (i.e. to remove \u2018<\u2019 symbols). Cells which have been highlighted blue signify that the value given was above the detection limit. ALS method:ME-MS41L (https://www.alsglobal.com/en/services-and-products/geochemistry/geochemistry-testing-and-analysis/whole-rock-analysis-and-lithogeochemistry) . The majority of the samples included in this data were collected in the UK, but, where appropriate, samples out with the UK were included. The majority of the data was collected from 2014 to 2019. Whole rock and sediment samples were analysed by solution ICP-MS. Samples of ~30 g were individually milled and homogenised, and 0.5 g were digested with aqua regia in a graphite heating block. The residue was diluted with deionised water (18 M\u00bf cm), mixed, and analysed using a Varian 725 instrument at ALS Minerals (Loughrea; method ID: ME-MS41L). This data was collected to better understand the low temperature cycling of Telurium (Te) and Sellenium (Se) in the geological environment. For example, a range of ochre samples were included in this database. Ochres are a modern precipitate commonly found in rivers and streams which flow through geographical areas with a history of mining resources which are rich in sulphides. Iron from the sulphides are leached out and deposited downstream, coating river and stream beds, giving a red, yellow or orange colouration. Ochres can be a sink for trace metals, so analysing the abundances of these can be informative from a resource perspective but also from an environmental hazard perspective. This would be useful for researchers who require reference data for whole rock and sediment data of a particular lithology or age. This data is was collected by, but not limited to the following individuals; John Parnell, Sam Spinks, Josef Armstrong, Liam A Bullock, Magali Perez, Xueying Wang & Connor Brolly.",
