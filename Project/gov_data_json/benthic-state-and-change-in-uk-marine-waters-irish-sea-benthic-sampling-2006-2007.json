This data is specifically from \nIrish sea samples collected in 2006-2007 and contains infromation on the \nabundance of macrofauna at each station.\n\nEnvironmental variables quantified for each station included bathymetry \n(except North Sea and western Scotland), stratification, bottom temperature \nand a number of derived granulometric parameters (e.g., % silt, % gravel, \nsorting coefficient, skewness, kurtosis), together with modelled parameters \nsuch as bed tidal stress, wave stress, bottom temperature, a stratification \nindex and satellite-derived surface chlorophyll a (mean values for 2002-07 \nused). \n\nEstimates of the benthic productivity associated with such communities were \nalso derived, for the first time, at this large spatial scale.",
