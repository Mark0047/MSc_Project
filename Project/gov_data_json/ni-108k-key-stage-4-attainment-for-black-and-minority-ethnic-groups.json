Minority ethnic groups measured for the purposes of this indicator include any ethnic group where there are over 30 pupils from that group in any particular cohort. Good performance is typified by higher percentages of pupils attaining 5 A*-C, including English and mathematics, accompanied by a narrowing of the attainment gap between minority ethnic pupils and all pupils.\r\n",
