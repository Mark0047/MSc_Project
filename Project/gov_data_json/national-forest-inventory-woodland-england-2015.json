        "notes": "Summary\nThe NFI definition of woodland is a minimum area of 0.5 hectares under stands of trees with, or with the potential\nto achieve, tree crown cover of more than 20% of the ground.\nAreas of young trees, which have the potential to achieve a canopy cover of more than 20%, will also be\ninterpreted as woodland and mapped. The minimum width for woodland is 20 m, although where woodlands are\nconnected by a narrow neck of woodland less than 20 m wide, the break may be disregarded if less than 20 m in\nextent.\nIntervening land classes such as Roads - all 'tarmac' roads should be excluded from the woodland area, but\ninternal forest tracks, farmers tracks, rides etc. willbe included as part of the woodland if < 20m wide.\nRivers - where the gap in woodland is 20m then rivers will be excluded from the woodland area.\nPower lines etc. - where the gap in woodland is 20m then power lines will be excluded from the woodland area.\nRailways - all normal gauge railways should be excluded from woodland\nScrubby vegetation\" is included within this survey where low woody growth seems to dominate a likely woodland\nsite.\nThe definition of an open area is any open area that is 20m wide and 0.5 ha in extent and is completely\nsurrounded by woodland.\nThe woodland boundaries have been interpreted from colour aerial orthophotographic imagery. For the base map,\nphotographic images aimed to be no older than 3 years at the time of mapping (i.e. areas mapped in 2007 would\nbe based on photographs that were ideally taken no earlier than 2004). As the map is be the basis for a longer\nrolling programme of sample field surveys it has been necessary to develop procedures to update the map to the\ndate of the field survey, currently 2011, for the purpose of reporting on the current phase.\nThe map is continually updated on an annual basis. These updates will are achieved by a combination of remote\nsensing and updated aerial imagery analysis for changes in the woodland structure and with reference to\navailable new planting information from grant schemes and the FE sub-compartment database.\nOrdnance Survey MasterMap\u00ae (OSMM) features have been used as a reference for capturing the woodland\nboundaries. OSMM is the most up to date large-scale digital map of GB providing a seamless database for\n1:1250, 1:2500 and 1:10000 survey data.\nAll woodland (both urban and rural, regardless of ownership) which is 0.5ha or greater in extent, with the\nexpection of Assumed woodland or Low density areas that can be 0.1ha or greater in extend, as been mapped\nWoodland that is less than 0.5ha in extent will not be described within the dataset but will be included in a\nseparate sample survey of small woodland and tree features.\n\nDescription.\nThe primary objective is to create a new digital map of all woodland in Great Britain using O.S.MasterMap\nfeatures as boundaries where appropriate. The map shows the extent of all woodland of 0.5 ha.Woodland\ncategories are defined by IFT (Interpreted Forest Type) values. Detailed Woodland categories are:\nBroadleaved\nConifer\nFelled\nGround Prepared for New Planting\nMixed - predominantly Broadleaved\nMixed - predominantly Conifer\nYoung Trees\nCoppice\nCoppice with Standards\nShrub Land\nUncertain\nCloud or Shadow\nLow Density\nAssumed woodland\nFailed\nWindthrow/Windblow\nNon woodland categories are defined by the IOA (Interpreted Open Area) values. Detailed Non woodland\ncategories are:\nAgriculture land\nBare area\nGrass\nOpen water\nOther vegetation\nPower line\nQuarry\nRiver\nRoad\nUrban\nWindfarm\nA full list of attributes can be found in the Data Lineage section.\n\n\nAny maps produced using this data should contain the following Forestry Commission\nacknowledgement: \"Contains, or is based on, information supplied by the Forestry Commission. \u00a9 Crown\ncopyright and database right [Year] Ordnance Survey [100021242]\".
