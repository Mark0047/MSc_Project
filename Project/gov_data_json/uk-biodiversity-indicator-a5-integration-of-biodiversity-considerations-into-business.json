        "notes": "This spreadsheet is the underlying data for the biodiversity indicator A5, Integration of biodiversity considerations into business.\n\nDecisions made by businesses of any size within key sectors such as agriculture, forestry, industry, housing and infrastructure development, water supply and fisheries can have significant biodiversity impacts.  Information on how biodiversity considerations have been integrated into agriculture, forestry and fisheries, is included in other UK indicators.  Other sectors were not previously adequately covered, this indicator therefore provides information on biodiversity considerations of businesses in the large mining, manufacturing and utilities sectors.  Production and consumption in the UK has an impact within the UK as well as overseas.\n\nThis indicator shows the percentage of large businesses (those with at least 250 employees) surveyed in the Environmental Protection Expenditure (EPE) Survey that operate at least one Environmental Management System (EMS), and the percentage of large companies that formally consider the environment during procurement and contract management relating to their supply chain.  The EPE survey covers large mining companies, manufacturing companies and utilities.\n\nThis is one of a suite of 24 UK biodiversity indicators published by JNCC on behalf of Defra; the latest publication date was 19 January 2016 - for indicator A5 the latest data are for 2013.",
