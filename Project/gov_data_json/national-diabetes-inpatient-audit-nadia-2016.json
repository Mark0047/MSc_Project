        "notes": "Making clinical audit data transparent \r\n\r\nIn his transparency and open data letter to Cabinet Ministers on 7 July 2011, the Prime Minister made a commitment to make clinical audit data available from the national audits within the National Clinical Audit and Patient Outcomes Programme. \r\n\r\nThe information available from this webpage comes from the National Diabetes Inpatient Audit. The National Diabetes Inpatient Audit is a snapshot audit of diabetes inpatient care. In September 2016 the National Diabetes Inpatient Audit was conducted in hospitals across England and Wales, collecting data on characteristics of the hospital including staffing structures, patient clinical data and patient experience information. \r\n\r\nWhat information is being made available? \r\n\r\n\uf0a7 Audit participation and data completeness for the key fields \r\n\r\n\uf0a7 Measures about the process of care given to patients \r\n\r\n\uf0a7 Information about care outcomes and treatment. \r\n\r\nThese data do not list individual patient information nor do they contain any patient identifiable data. \r\n\r\nUsing and interpreting the data \r\n\r\nData from the National Diabetes Inpatient Audit should not be looked at in isolation when assessing standards of care. \r\n\r\nAccessing the data \r\n\r\nThe data are being made available on the data.gov website. Each year a data file from the National Diabetes Inpatient Audit will be made available in CSV format. Hospitals are identified by name and their national code. \r\n\r\nWhat does the data cover? \r\n\r\nThe audit looks at the following areas: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Did diabetes management minimise the risk of avoidable complications? \r\n\r\n\u2022 Did harm result from the inpatient stay? \r\n\r\n\u2022 Was patient experience of the inpatient stay favourable? \r\n\r\n\u2022 Has the quality of care and patient feedback changed? \r\n\r\nWhat period does the data cover? \r\n\r\nThis data covers patients surveyed on a date between 26 and 30 September 2016. The audit report was published on 08 March 2017.",
