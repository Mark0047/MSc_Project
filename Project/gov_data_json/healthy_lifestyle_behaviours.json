The variables are: 1) Current smoking among adults (aged 16 or over). 2) Binge drinking for adults (aged 16 or over). 3) Obesity among adults (aged 16 or over). 4) Consumption of 5 or more portions of fruit and vegetables a day among adults (aged 16 or over).\r\nSource: The Information Centre for health and social care (IC)\r\nPublisher: Neighbourhood Statistics\r\nGeographies: Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA), Local Authority District (LAD), Primary Care Trust (PCT), Strategic Health Authority (SHA)\r\nGeographic coverage: England\r\nTime coverage: 2003-2005\r\nType of data: Modelled data\r\nGuidelines: For reference purposes each MSOA/LA is compared to the direct (i.e. non model-based) estimate for England by examining whether its 95% confidence interval overlaps with the confidence interval for the Health Survey for England national estimate (NE). A score of 1 indicates that the MSOA/LA estimate is significantly lower than the national estimate; 2 implies no significant difference and 3 indicates an estimate that is significantly higher.",
