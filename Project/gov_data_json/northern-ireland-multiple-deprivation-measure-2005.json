        "notes": "The 2005 Northern Ireland Multiple Deprivation Measure (NIMDM 2005) contains seven domains of deprivation: \r\n\u2022 Income Deprivation \r\n\u2022 Employment Deprivation \r\n\u2022 Health Deprivation and Disability \r\n\u2022 Education, Skills and Training Deprivation \r\n\u2022 Proximity to Services Deprivation \r\n\u2022 Living Environment Deprivation \r\n\u2022 Crime and Disorder Indicators. \r\n\r\nEach domain contains a number of indicators, totalling 43 overall. Where possible, the indicators relate to 2003. \r\nThe criteria for inclusion of these indicators were that they should be: \r\n\u2022 \u2018domain specific\u2019 and appropriate for the purpose (as direct as possible measures of that form of deprivation); \r\n\u2022 measuring major features of that deprivation (not conditions just experienced by a very small number of people or areas); \r\n\u2022 up-to-date; \r\n\u2022 capable of being updated on a regular basis; \r\n\u2022 statistically robust; and \r\n\u2022 available for the whole of Northern Ireland at a small area level in a consistent form.\r\n\r\nResults are provided for these domains and the overall multiple deprivation measure in the form of ranks.  Areas are ordered from most deprived (rank 1) to least deprived.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Ireland Multiple Deprivation Measure 2005 report is available at https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/northern-ireland-multiple-deprivation-measure-2005-report\r\n\r\nPlease note that the csv deprivation files were created by the Open Data Team as a sample csv for NISRA. \r\n",

Digital NI aims to help establish a culture within Northern Ireland that develops and enhances Digital capability not just through interactions with Government, but also with local companies and throughout communities. Within government the Digital Transformation Service is facilitating this cultural shift through a number of methods, transforming Government services, making data open and available and encouraging and coaching those who lack digital skills.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that opening up our data is the right thing to do in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the Public Sector in Northern Ireland. It has the potential to encourage new commercial opportunities and drive economic growth and innovation across public and private sectors.",

The flow chart in Appendix 7 summarises the process. The Northern Ireland Multiple Deprivation Measure 2005 report is available at https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/northern-ireland-multiple-deprivation-measure-2005-report .\r\n\r\nThis data include ranks and scores at Super Output Area level for the Northern Ireland Multiple Deprivation Measure 2005, the seven constituent domains and the two stand-alone measures: Income Deprivation Affecting Children and Income Deprivation Affecting Older People. The seven Domain Measures (and weights) are: Income (25%), Employment (25%), Health Deprivation and Disability (15%), Education, Skills and Training (15%), Proximity to Services (10%), Living Environment (5%) and Crime and Disorder (5%). For each variable a rank of 1 denotes the most deprived SOA in Northern Ireland and a rank of 890 denotes the least deprived SOA in Northern Ireland. Also included at Electoral Ward level results. The ward measures were created by taking a weighted average of the SOA results. Weights were determined by total population size of SOAs within each ward. There are three domains which lend themselves to presentation at the very small area level. These are Income Deprivation, Employment Deprivation and Proximity to Services Deprivation. A measure of Economic Deprivation has been created by combining these three domains. The Economic Deprivation measure does not form part of the overall NIMDM 2005 but is a stand-alone measure. The Population Estimate variable was calculated as part of the NIMDM 2005 project and relates to mid-2003. This estimate includes armed forces personnel and excludes prisoners. Populations rounded to nearest 5. It was replaced by an updated small area population estimate on 31 March 2010. \r\n\r\nVariable: Multiple Deprivation Measure Rank, Income Domain Score, Income Domain Rank, Employment Domain Score, Employment Domain Rank, Health Deprivation and Disability Domain Rank, Education, Skills and Training Domain Rank, Proximity to Services Domain Rank, Living Environment Domain Rank, Crime and Disorder Domain Rank, Income Deprivation Affecting Children Score, Income Deprivation Affecting Children Rank, Income Deprivation Affecting Older People Score, Income Deprivation Affecting Older People Rank, Education, Skills and Training Domain - Child Sub-Domain Rank, Education, Skills and Training Domain - Adult Sub-Domain Rank, Living Environment Domain - Housing Quality Sub-Domain Rank, Living Environment Domain - Housing Access Sub-Domain Rank, Living Environment Domain - Outdoor Physical Environment Sub-Domain Rank, Crime and Disorder Domain - Crime Sub-Domain Rank, Crime and Disorder Domain - Disorder Sub-Domain Rank, Economic Deprivation Measure, Road distance to a GP premises (km), Road distance to an A and E hospital (km), Road distance to a dentist (km), Road distance to an optician (km), Road distance to a pharmacist (km), Road distance to a Jobs and Benefit Office (km), Road distance to a Post Office (km), Road distance to a food shop with 50 employees or more (km), Road distance to centre of a settlement of 10000 or more people (km), Population Estimate (NIMDM 2005).\r\n\r\nDisclosure Control Methods: Mostly ranks are presented in this dataset. When scores are presented they are rounded to two decimal places and do not disclose personal information.\r\n\r\nQuality Issues: The quality of the data is very good.
