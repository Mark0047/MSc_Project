However, this dataset should still be used for information on permits that were historic before came under EPR regulations. This dataset should be used in conjunction with the Historic Landfill Sites points dataset (NRW_DS125453), which is the most comprehensive dataset for recently expired, surrendered, or revoked landfill sites.\r\nHistoric Landfill Sites is a spatial (polygon) dataset. These are landfill sites which have been taken off the Authorised Landfill Sites when the waste licence status changes to either:\r\n- Licence expired: Some licences issued under the Control of Pollution Act 1974 were time limited and expired on the date specified in the licence.\r\n- Licence Revoked: Whereby the licence has been entirely revoked and is no longer in force; or\r\n- Licence Surrendered: Operator has successfully surrendered the licence which is no longer in force.\r\nUnder the Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order 1995 Local Planning Authorities have to consult with the former Environment Agency Wales, now part of Natural Resources Wales, about all applications they receive to develop land within 250 metres of landfill sites (including any land that has been used as a landfill site within the past 30 years or is likely to be used as one in the near future). The Historic Landfill dataset was created to help fulfil our statutory responsibility to Local Planning Authorities by supplying information on the risks posed by landfill sites for development within 250 m.  The data is the most comprehensive and consistent national historic landfill dataset and defines the location of, and provides specific attributes for, known historic\r\n(closed) landfill sites, i.e. sites where there is no PPC permit or waste management licence currently in force. This includes sites that existed before the waste licensing regime and sites that have been licensed in the past but where this licence has been revoked, ceased to exist or surrendered and a certificate of completion has been issued.\r\n\r\n    ",
