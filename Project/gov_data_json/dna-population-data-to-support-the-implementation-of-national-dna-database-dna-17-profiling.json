        "notes": "The new profiling system is known as DNA 17 and this file provides background data to its use.\r\n\r\nThe National DNA Database was launched in 1995 with SGM (Second Generation Multiplex) DNA profiling.  This test produced a DNA profile at six target areas of DNA and a gender marker. SGM was superseded in 1999 by SGM PlusTM DNA profiling which produced a test result at ten areas of DNA and a gender marker.  SGM Plus incorporated the same target areas of DNA as SGM with an additional four areas. In the summer of 2014, the National DNA Database will launch DNA-17 profiling. This test will produce a DNA profile at sixteen target areas of DNA and gender marker. DNA-17 incorporates the same target areas as SGM Plus along with an additional six areas.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
