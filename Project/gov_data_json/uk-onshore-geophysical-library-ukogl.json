The Library manages the archive and official release of seismic data recorded over landward areas of the UK. By agreement with the DTI and HMSO, the Library operates as a registered charity, funded by revenues raised from data sales and donations, with the long term objective of bringing all available UK onshore digital seismic data into secure archival storage, whilst providing efficient access to all interested parties. BGS has access to the data at cost of copying only for science budget work. Data index on the BGS Geoscience Data Index.",
