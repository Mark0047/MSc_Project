The purpose was to collect data as part of the NERC Land-Ocean Interaction Study (LOIS). British Geological Survey were a participant in the LOIS study. Sub-bottom profiling data were collected using surface tow boomer. Navigation positioning GPS system. These data are archived by UCNW. Survey details are contained in University College of North Wales report \u201cGeophysical studies in the Humber and Tees Estuaries and the Fenland/Wash area by A. M. Davies, J. D. Bennel, J. Butcher, C. Hartfall, I. Richarson and B. Williams\u201d. NERC contract F60/G12/15.",
