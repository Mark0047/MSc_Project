They cover new General Needs lettings, at social rent levels, owned by Local Authorities (LAs). All figures are unweighted and are therefore not fully consistent with the weighted social rent data at national level in the 'Social Housing Lettings in England' statistical release.\r\n\r\nSome Local Authority areas are missing from the Local Authority owned datasets due to there being either no LA owned lettings in that area, or there being too few lettings in an area for the data to be released, as it is deemed disclosive.\r\n\r\nData are given for the mean number of days that a property was vacant for prior to a new general needs social rent LA letting. The time vacant is defined as the period between the void (or new build handover) date or major repairs completion date (if major repairs carried out during the void period), and the tenancy start date.",
