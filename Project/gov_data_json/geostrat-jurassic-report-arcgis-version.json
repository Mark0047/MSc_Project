The contents do not necessarily reflect the technical view of the OGA but the report is being published in the interests of making additional sources of data and interpretation available for use by the wider industry and academic communities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Geostrat report provides stratigraphic analyses and interpretations of data from the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous Humber Group across the UK Central Graben and includes a series of depositional sequence maps for eight stratigraphic intervals. Stratigraphic interpretations and tops from 189 wells (up to Release 91) are also included in the report.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The outputs as published here include a full PDF report, ODM/IC .dat format sequence maps, and all stratigraphic tops (lithostratigraphy, ages, sequence stratigraphy) in .csv format (for import into different interpretation platforms).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In addition, the OGA has undertaken to provide the well tops, stratigraphic interpretations and sequence maps in an ESRI ArcGIS format that is intended to facilitate the integration of these data into projects and data storage systems held by individual organisations. As part of this process, the Geostrat well names have been matched as far as possible to the OGA well names from the OGA Offshore Wells shapefile (as provided on the OGA\u2019s Open Data website) and the original polygon files have been incorporated into an ArcGIS project. All the files within the GIS folder of this delivery have been created by the OGA. OGA web feature services (WFSs) have been included in the map document in this delivery. They replace the use of a shapefile or feature class to represent block, licence and quadrant data. By using a WFS, the data is automatically updated when it becomes available via the OGA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A version of this delivery containing shapefiles for well tops, stratigraphic interpretations and sequence maps is available on the OGA\u2019s Open Data website for use in other GIS software packages.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All releases included in the Data Purchase tender process that have been made openly available are summarised in a mapping application available from the OGA website. The application includes an area of interest outline for each of the products and an overview of which wellbores have been included in the products.</p>",
