        "notes": "**FOCUS**ON**LONDON**2010:**HEALTH**:CHILDREN**AND**YOUNG**PEOPLE**\n\nThe health and wellbeing of London\u2019s children and young people is fundamental to the health of the city. The recent Marmot Review of health inequalities noted that \u201cWhat a child experiences during the early years lays down the foundation for the whole of their life.\u201d The Mayor\u2019s Health Inequality Strategy for London responds to this by challenging all partners in London to create \u201cconditions that lead to better early years experiences\u201d.\n\nThis chapter, authored by colleagues at the London Health Observatory, provides recent evidence on the health experience of children and young people in London. The report includes data about the Local Index of Child Wellbeing, infant mortality, breastfeeding, immunisation, injury, childhood obesity, physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, drug use, teenage conceptions and sexual health. It reveals many areas of inequality within the city, but also highlights the ways in which London\u2019s children are doing well.\n\n**REPORT:**\n\nAccess the full report in [PDF format](https://londondatastore-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/fol/FocusOnLondon2010-Health.pdf)\n\n![](https://londondatastore-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/fol/fol10-health-cover-thumb.png)\n\n**PRESENTATION:**\n\nThis interactive presentation about children\u2019s health in London looks into some of the factors that may have an effect on the high childhood obesity figures in London.\n\nAccess the presentation at [Prezi.com](http://prezi.com/pc-e7c1lwz_p/focus-on-london-2010-health-children-and-young-people/)\n\n**CHART:**\n\nThis interactive scatterplot allows users to observe the relationship between some of the health indicators in the report with a selection of other socio-economic data for each of London\u2019s 32 boroughs.\n\n[Scatterplot](http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/visualizations/scatterplot-of-health-indicators-v)\n\n**RANKINGS:**\n\nAn informative regional rankings scorecard has been created showing where London sits in relation to the other English regions on a number of indicators contained within the report.\n\n[Rankings](https://londondatastore-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/fol/FoL2010-Health-Ranking-Scorecard.pdf)\n\n**DATA:**\n\nAll the data contained within the health report and used to create the scatterplot and rankings scorecard can be accessed in this [spreadsheet](https://londondatastore-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/fol/fol-2010-health-report-data.xls).\n\n**FACTS:**\n\nSome interesting facts from the report\u2026\n\n\u25cf Five boroughs with highest teenage conception rates in 2008:\n\n1.
