        "notes": "[This dataset is embargoed until January 2, 2025]. This dataset contains includes measurements of trees and lianas stem diameters and status (e.g. alive, dead), and lightning strike data for forest areas within the Ankasa Conservation Area, collected between June 2018 and July 2021. We investigated tree mortality drive by lightning strikes in a 50-ha (1000 m x 500 m) plot area in the Ankasa Conservation Area, located in southwestern Ghana. The 50-ha was divided into 50 x 1-ha forest plots. In every census, we measured and tagged all trees and lianas that have a stem diameter at 1.3 m (or above buttresses) of \u226525 cm and notes were taken about the tree's living status (e.g., broken, hollow) or the trees death mode (e.g., uprooted, standing). Lightning strike data was collected from a subsample of the individual trees recorded in the census data.
