        "notes": "This marine geophysical survey was carried out by British Geological Survey (BGS) and engineers from Hunting Surveys Ltd, and IOS Barry. The survey took place in August to October 1974 around Shetland, Orkney and off north west Scotland on board the MV Briarthorn. The purpose was to collect data for UK regional mapping. Sea floor data were collected using Transit Sonar. Subsurface data were gathered using a suite of seismic instruments (airgun, pinger and sparker), plus a gravity meter and a magnetometer. These data were recorded as paper records and are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS report WB/MG/74/54.",
