        "notes": "Data are presented showing seedling height, diameter at ground height (DGH), total number of leaves, number of leaves with herbivory damage and leaf mortality, from a plot based fertilisation experiment. The experiment was carried out at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) approximately 100 km north of Manaus. Data were collected bimonthlyfrom February 2019 to January 2020, by the dataset first author. Height measurements were made with a tape measure and DRH measurements were made with digital calipers. Leaf numbers, damage and mortality were made from visual observations. The data were collected to investigate the possible effects of different fertiliser applications on seedling height, totalnumber of leaves, number of leaves with herbivory damage and leaf mortality.The work was carried out as part of the Amazon Fertilization Experiment (AFEX), funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), Award reference NE/L007223/1, by the Brazilian government (Researcher scholarship) and the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP - logistical support and camps maintanance).
