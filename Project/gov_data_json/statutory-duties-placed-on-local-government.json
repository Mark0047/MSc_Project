At no point in recent history has there been a comprehensive list of legal duties placed on local authorities.\r\nThe Government therefore agreed with the Local Government Association that we should compile a list of these duties to give clarity about what these are.\r\nOn 30 June 2011, a summary of the responses and the latest revised list of duties were published. This exercise has successfully enabled a clearer picture of the requirements on local authorities, and created a valuable record that had previously not existed. (See 'Resources' below).\r\nThe review has now closed. Any future consideration of whether to remove specific duties or associated guidance will be a separate exercise, and Government will consult further as appropriate.\r\n",
