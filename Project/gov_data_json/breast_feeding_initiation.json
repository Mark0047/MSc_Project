The data is originally recorded at PCT level which has been converted to LA level using birth weighting.

A LA will not have an estimate, if any of its component PCTs have not returned data or have invalid data. 92% of LAs have less than or equal to 5% mothers with unknown breast feeding initiation status and were therefore deemed as having valid prevalence estimates to be included in the Health Profiles 2009.",
