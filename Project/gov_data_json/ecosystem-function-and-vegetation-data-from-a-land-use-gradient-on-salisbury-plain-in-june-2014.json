        "notes": "This dataset contains ecosystem function and vegetation survey data from soils collected from Salisbury Plain, UK. The sites were selected to reflect the four main grassland management types on Salisbury Plain ranging from arable cropland to species rich grassland, with six representative grassland plots for each type (24 sites in total). Each site had four replicates for each variable measured. The data collected was intended to illustrate a gradient of ecosystem functioning and vegetation change as the grassland becomes more extensively managed. The field sampling was conducted by the University of Manchester and the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology at Wallingford. Soils were extracted for nutrients and analysed by the University of Manchester. The data includes vegetation surveys, where the cover of each plant species present was assessed, and diversity indices were calculated. Furthermore, greenhouse gas fluxes were measured in situ, and soil nutrients and microbial biomass were also determined. Full details about this dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5285/0e0a89e1-21f9-413e-8d7e-764b0b714dd6",
