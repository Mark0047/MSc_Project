A directory for each of the field sites investigated by the research team, as well as modern data from various laboratory and field simulations. Scans of individual footprints are an ASCII format, each of which contains the X, Y and Z for a digital elevation model. In most cases there is a site map in PDF format providing a key to the prints and file names. In some cases jpeg thumb nails of the scans are also provided. Most directories contain a PDF text file of additional information detailing the equipment used, collection methods, and precision/accuracy of the data, along with any available academic references.",
