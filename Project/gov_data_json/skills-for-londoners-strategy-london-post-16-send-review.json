        "notes": "**In 2019 the GLA commissioned education specialists Mime to provide an up-to-date picture of\u00a0supply and demand\u00a0of Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND) provision for 16-25 year olds in London.**\n\nThe Area Reviews of London\u2019s Further Education provision and the London Adult Community Learning (ACL) Review recommended that more work should be done to determine future SEND demand to ensure that an evidence-based approach can be taken to planning post-16 SEND services.\n\nMime, who specialise in obtaining insight from educational data to improve the life chances of young people, was appointed to conduct a London-wide SEND review. The purpose of the review was to identify the gap in post-16 SEND provision in London and produce a sustainable methodology for projecting demand that could inform future planning cycles. The project team included SEND specialists and was supported by a steering group that included a range of experienced stakeholders from across London.\n\nThe project consisted of five parts; a demand model that projected the number of 16 to 25 year olds with EHCPs with different levels of learning support, an analysis of current supply, a gap analysis, an EHCP review, and stakeholder interviews. Key findings from the analysis were used to derive recommendations for the SEND sector in London. The review took place between January and July 2018.",
