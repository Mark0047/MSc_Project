Digital NI aims to help establish a culture within Northern Ireland that develops and enhances Digital capability not just through interactions with Government, but also with local companies and throughout communities. Within government the Digital Transformation Service is facilitating this cultural shift through a number of methods, transforming Government services, making data open and available and encouraging and coaching those who lack digital skills.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that opening up our data is the right thing to do in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the Public Sector in Northern Ireland. It has the potential to encourage new commercial opportunities and drive economic growth and innovation across public and private sectors.",

However, this does not necessarily mean that 7 individuals passed this point, as a person could pass the same counter several times on any one journey.\r\nAt the bottom of each hourly record, is a summary indicating the following:\r\n07-19, is the 12hr Flow from 07:00-19:00;\r\n06-22, is the 16hr Flow from 06:00-22:00;\r\n06-24, is the 18hr Flow from 06:00-24:00; and\r\n00-24, is the 24hr Flow from 06:00-24:00.\r\n \t \t\t\r\nAM Peak\t11:00:00, indicated hour of highest flow AM (in this example from 11:00-12:00);\r\nPeak Volume 7, indicates volume during this highest AM Flow hour;\r\nPM Peak\t15:00:00: indicated hour highest flow PM (in this example from 15:00-16:00); and\r\nPeak Volume 2, indicates volume during highest PM Flow hour.\r\n\r\nTo the right of each sheet, is the average daily flow for each hour for working days (Monday \u2013Friday) and the average daily flow for the whole week (7 days)."
