These charts provide annual and \nmonthly fisheries statistics at a fine spatial scale for the period 1913-81 \n(excluding both World Wars). More specifically, they show the annual and \nmonthly landings and catch rates per fish species, and the fishing effort for \nvarious components of the British commercial fishing fleet. These values are \nindicated separately for each rectangle of 1\u00b0 longitude by 30' latitude \n(equivalent to International Council for the Exploration of the Sea [ICES] \nrectangles) as well as for the entire area charted (generally equivalent to \nICES fishing areas).",
