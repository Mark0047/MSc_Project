        "notes": "      Water Framework Directive (WFD) Groundwater bodies Cycle 1 is a spatial (polygon) dataset containing attributes that have been collated as defined for the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD).  Article 2, clause 2 of the WFD defines them as '...all water which is below the surface of the ground in the saturation zone and in direct contact with the ground or subsoil'.  For the purposes of reporting under the WFD a groundwater body represent a distinct body of groundwater flow with a coherent flow unit including recharge and discharge areas with little flow across the boundaries.  These reflect hydrogeological characteristics containing information on flow and stage properties, recharge and vulnerability to pollution.  This has been undertaken through definin\r\ng aquifers into different types and broken into catchment units at Catchment Abstraction Management Strategy (CAMS) scale. Since water bodies are attributed with a unique identifier (EA_WB_ID) this dataset can be linked directly to other WFD data sources such as physical characteristics, risk, classification and proposed objectives.\r\n\r\n    ",
