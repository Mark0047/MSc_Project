LiDAR data was captured in 2010 and 2012 and processed in LAZ format to 0.5m resolution with a point density of 4 points per square metre.\n\nPlease Note: This data is not to be used for any commercial purpose as specified  by the original supplier Fugro.\n\nThe sites:\n\n1)\tEdinburgh Old and New Town (10 tiles: NT2374, NT2574, NT 2574, NT2674, NT2373, NT2473, NT2573, NT2673, NT2773, NT2572)\n\n2)\tThe Heart of Neolithic Orkney 2010 epoch (228 tiles: HY3010; ND2899) \nNB: a 2nd epoch of LiDAR data was captured of part of this same area in 2018 for HES\n\n3)\tSt Kilda 32 x 500m\u00b2 tiles covering Hirta, Soay, Boreray and Levenish from the following 1km\u00b2 tiles: NA0500, NA0501, NA0502, NA0600, NA0601, NA0602, NA0700, NA0701, NA0702, NA0800, NA0801, NA0900, NA1000, NA1404, NA1405, NA1504, NA1505, NA1506, NF0798, NF0799, NF0898, NF0899, NF0997, NF0998, NF0999, NF1097, NF1098, NF1099, NF1197, NF1198, NF1199, NF1396.\n\n4)\tThe Antonine Wall (84 tiles: NT0380; NS4573) NB: Additional area coverage was added from the same source tiles that had been captured by Fugro in 2010, in 2013, to complete coverage of a broader area of the Antonine Wall beyond the WHS\n\n5)\tNew Lanark (5 tiles: NS8743, NS8742, NS8842, NS8741, NS8841)\n\nData was originally supplied as XYZI Raw data in *.xyz (ASCII) format and 0.5m LAS data as Terrain and Surface data\n\nThis data is available on the Scottish Remote Sensing Portal as LAZ and GeoTiff (converted from the original supplied data)\n\nA *.pdf of each area indicating the extent was supplied depicting the area captured in the dataset\n\nOrthophotos were supplied alongside this data as *. Tif and include *.TFW files, these are held by Historic Environment Scotland and require different licencing than is covered by the data documentation referenced here.",
