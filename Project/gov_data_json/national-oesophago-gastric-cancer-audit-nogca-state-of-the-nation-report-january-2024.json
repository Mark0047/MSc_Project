The audit aims to support NHS services to improve the quality of care delivered to these patients.\r\n\r\nThe National Oesophago-Gastric Cancer Audit is a collaborative, national clinical audit run by the Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgery of Great Britain & Ireland (AUGIS), British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG), Royal College of Radiologists, NHS England, and the National Cancer Audit Collaborating Centre at the Clinical Effectiveness Unit of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. The audit is part of the National Clinical Audit and Patient Outcomes Programme (NCAPOP), that is managed by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership.\r\n\r\nThe NOGCA data file contains the results published within the January 2024 State of the Nation Report for English NHS trusts and Welsh health boards. The organisational figures are based on data from patients diagnosed with OG cancer or HGD up to 31 March 2022.\r\n\r\nThe data file contains information on: \u2022 Audit participation by NHS organisation and data completeness for the key fields. \u2022 Measures about the process of care given to patients. \u2022 Information about care outcomes and treatment.\r\n\r\nThese data files do not contain individual patient information, nor do they contain any patient identifiable data.",
