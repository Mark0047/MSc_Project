        "notes": "The depth difference dataset (2004) is a depth grid showing the difference between modelled fluvial flood depths and modelled fluvial flood depths under climate change conditions (an increase in peak flows of 20%). \n\nModelled fluvial flood depth and climate change depth difference data* was created for both the 1% annual chance of flooding situations and was produced as a by-product from the 2004 generalised modelling project. The purpose of the generalised modelling project was to fill the gaps where there was no detailed local modelled data in 2004, in order to define the extents of Flood Zones for spatial planning.\n\nA two-dimensional hydrodynamic model called JFlow was used to produce both the modelled fluvial flood depth and modelled fluvial flood depth with climate change data. This depth difference data, using these 2 datasets, is provided on a 5x5m grid.\n\nSince 2004, some local detailed modelling projects have included scenarios for climate change however this depth difference dataset has not been updated.\n\nINFORMATION WARNING: This data is not suitable for identifying whether an individual property will flood due to climate change, for detailed decision making or for use in site specific Flood Risk or Strategic Flood Risk Assessments. Where this data is used further evidence, verification and studies should be undertaken. Climate change allowances have changed since this work was completed in 2004.\n\nMore recent, accurate and local detailed modelling depth data with climate change is available for some places. Please contact your local Environment Agency office to see if detailed modelling is available for your area of interest. \n\nThis metadata record is for Approval for Access product AfA480 2004 1 in 100 Fluvial Depth Grid Climate Change Difference\n\nModelled fluvial flood depth data with climate change are available for the whole of England, however this data is for the 100x100km squared Ordnance Survey National Grid reference   SK. If you are interested in data for another grid reference refer to this Ordnance Survey National Grid document to find the relevant referencing code and search on Data.gov.uk again to download the data.
