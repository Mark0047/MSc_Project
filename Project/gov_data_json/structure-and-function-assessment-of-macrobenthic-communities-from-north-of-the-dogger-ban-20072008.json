        "notes": "Four infaunal replicate samples were collected at each site using 0.1 m2 \nNioz corers (diameter of approximately 30 cm) were sieved on a 1mm mesh sieve, \nthe sieve remains were then sorted and preserved following the methodology \ndescribed by Boyd (2002). On return, to the laboratory all the infaunal \nsamples were identified to the lowest taxonomic level as possible, counted and \nweighted.\n\n Five epifaunal replicate samples were collected at each site using 2 m beam \ntrawls during each of the five research cruises. Each trawl was conducted at a \nconstant speed (~2 knots per minute) and sampled an area of seabed of \napproximately 400 m2. Once on board, the contents of the trawl were sieved \nover 5mm mesh and all retained individuals were identified, counted and \nweighed. In some cases, the very high numbers of some groups (e.g. brittle \nstars, shrimps, and small fish) needed sub-sampling before counting and \nweighting.\n\nThe raw abundance and biomass data for both the infauna (from the cores) and \nepifauna (trawls) were scaled to values per m2. As some taxa were present in \nboth datasets, taxa which were more appropriately classed as infauna and/or \ntheir densities were better estimated via a corer were classed as infauna and \nremoved from the trawl data. Accordingly, those taxa which were generally \nconsidered as epifaunal (and their numbers and biomasses better estimated \nusing a trawl) were considered as epifaunal and/or their densities more \nsuitably estimated using a trawl were reported as epifauna.",
