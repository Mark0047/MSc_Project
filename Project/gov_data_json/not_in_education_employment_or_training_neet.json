This leaves the number of young people not in education or training (NET). Data from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) is then used to estimate what proportion of the NET group is NEET. The Client Caseload Information System (CCIS) is a database run by Connexions in local areas to record information about the young people they work with. CCIS data provides us with a monthly picture of the proportion of young people NEET in every local authority.",
