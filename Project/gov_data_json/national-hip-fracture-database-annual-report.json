        "notes": "All 174 trauma units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland regularly uploaded data describing the process, quality and outcome of the care they provided to the 67,302 people who presented with hip fracture in 2019. This report uses six NHFD key performance indicators (KPIs) to describe how the quality of care varies between hospitals and changes over time. The impact of COVID-19 on patient care and the organisation of trauma services will be examined in detail in next year\u2019s NHFD report, but this year\u2019s report helps units measure their readiness and prepare for the challenging time that we continue to face.  \r\n\r\nHip fracture is a serious and costly injury affecting mainly older people, and is more common in women. It usually results from the combination of weak bone structure (osteoporosis) and a fall. Around 76,000 hip fractures occur each year in the UK as a whole. Although there is good evidence on best practice in surgical, medical and rehabilitation care following hip fracture, such care and its outcomes \u2013 in terms of return home and also of mortality \u2013 continues to vary.\r\n\r\nThe National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD), which was launched in 2007, aims to deliver improvements in the care of hip fracture patients. It documents case-mix, care and outcomes of hip fracture patients in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and is now, with more than 500,000 cases on record \u2013 by far the largest hip fracture audit in the world.\r\n\r\nIt has demonstrated broad improvements at local and national level in patient care, and in England has supported the Department of Health\u2019s highly successful Best Practice Tariff for hip fracture care. The work of the NHFD is now being replicated in Ireland, with the recent launch of Irish Hip Fracture Database, and similar developments are in hand in Australia and New Zealand, Canada and Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nThe National Hip Fracture Database was founded as a collaboration between the British Orthopaedic Association and the British Geriatrics Society. It was developed between 2004 and 2007, and since 2009 it has received central funding as a national clinical audit via the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP). Since April 2012 the NHFD has continued as part of the Falls and Fragility Fracture Audit Programme, managed on behalf of HQIP by the Royal College of Physicians (London).\r\n\r\nThe audit covers England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man, however data files only refer to data for England and Wales.",

            "description": "The Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP) was established in April 2008 to promote quality in healthcare, and in particular to increase the impact that clinical audit has on healthcare quality improvement. HQIP is an independent organisation led by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, The Royal College of Nursing, and National Voices and it works in partnership with patients and healthcare professionals to influence and improve healthcare practice at all levels. \r\n\r\nHQIP commissions, manages, supports, and promotes national and local programmes of quality improvement. This includes the national clinical audit programmes, the Clinical Outcome Review Programmes and the National Joint Registry on behalf of NHS England and other healthcare departments and organisations.  \r\n\r\nIn compliance with its commissioning status, HQIP:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Uses best management and procurement practice to ensure robust results and actionable recommendations.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Ensures patients and carers remain at the heart of its work through continued, strategic involvement in all relevant processes and projects.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Supports professionals to review and improve their practice by providing education and training programmes, and opportunities to share best practice as part of promoting an integrated approach to quality improvement.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Works to inform and influence national healthcare policy by effectively communicating its work and that of its partners.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Encourages wide use of robust data for quality improvement of care, offering patient choice, promoting patient safety, supporting revalidation and service accreditation, commissioning, service redesign, and research.\r\n\r\nFurther information about the HQIP Board, the team, and the organisations that HQIP work with is available on the HQIP website at http://www.hqip.org.uk/about-us/.",
