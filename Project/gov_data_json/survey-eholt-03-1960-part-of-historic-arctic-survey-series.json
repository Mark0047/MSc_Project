        "notes": "This survey was undertaken by Cefas as part of the Historic Arctic Survey \nSeries;\n\n*Gadus morhua* (Atlantic Cod) stocks in the Barents Sea are currently at \nlevels not seen since the 1950s. Causes for the population increase last \ncentury, and understanding of whether such large numbers will be maintained in \nthe future, are unclear. To explore this, we digitised and interrogated \nhistorical cod catch and diet datasets from the Barents Sea. Data includes \ntemporal and spatial information, cod catch data and length distributions, and \nhydrographic data.\n\nSurvey took place between 20/04/1960 and 12/05/1960 on Ernest Holt\n\nEquipment used during this survey :\n\n\n-   Otter Trawl 78ft Granton with shrimp netting cover\n\nSurvey operations were undertaken on 73 stations\n\n28 different species were caught on this survey",
