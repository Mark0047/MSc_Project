        "notes": "This record is for Approval for Access product AfA329. International Waste Shipments Records of International shipments permitted under the Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 2007. Shipments into or out of the UK qualify as International Waste Shipments. They are registered to the country where the producer or receiver is registered, regardless of the exit or entrance point from/to the UK.\nThe Environment Agency holds details of producers and receivers registered in England. This dataset initially covers Refuse Derived Fuel, with other waste types being added over time. Refuse-derived fuel (RDF) is waste typically from the mechanical treatment of waste (for example sorting, crushing, compacting, pelletising, etc). RDF consists largely of combustible components of both municipal and commercial industrial waste, such as plastics and biodegradable waste.\nShipments are recorded in four groups; Waste leaving the UK, Waste arriving in another country from the UK, Waste leaving another country destined for the UK, and Waste arriving in the UK from another country.\n\u2022 Waste exported from England, permitted under the Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 2007.\n\u2022 Waste received from England, permitted under the Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 2007.\n\u2022 Waste imported from England, permitted under the Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 2007.\n\u2022 Waste received in England, permitted under the Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 2007.\nPermit holders give indicative figures for how much waste they wish to have approved for import/export. They are not forecasts or projections.\n\u2022 Indicative amounts of waste anticipated for export, permitted under the Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 2007. These are broad approvals. They give an inaccurate overestimate of actual exports. \n\u2022 Indicative amounts of waste anticipated for import, permitted under the Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 2007.
