        "notes": "Making clinical audit data transparent\r\n\r\nIn his transparency and open data letter to Cabinet Ministers on 7 July 2011, the Prime Minister made a commitment to make clinical audit data available from the national audits within the National Clinical Audit and Patient Outcomes Programme. \r\n\r\nThe National Diabetes Foot Care Audit (NDFA) is a continuous audit of diabetic foot disease in England and Wales. The audit enables all diabetes foot care services to measure their performance against NICE clinical guidelines and peer units, and to monitor adverse outcomes for people with diabetes who develop diabetic foot disease. \r\n\r\nWhat information is being made available? \uf0a7 \r\n\r\nTrust, service, sustainability and transformation partnership (STP), and clinical commissioning group (CCG) audit participation and data completeness for the key fields \r\n\r\nMeasures about the process of care given to patients \uf0a7 \r\n\r\nInformation about care outcomes and treatment. \r\n\r\nThese data do not list individual patient information nor do they contain any patient identifiable data. \r\n\r\nUsing and interpreting the data \r\n\r\nData from the National Diabetes Foot Care Audit should not be looked at in isolation when assessing standards of care. \r\n\r\nAccessing the data \r\n\r\nThe data are being made available on the data.gov website. Each year a data file from the National Diabetes Foot Care Audit will be made available in CSV format. Trusts and CCGs are identified by name and national code. Foot care services and STPs are identified by name and locally derived code. \r\n\r\nWhat does the data cover? \r\n\r\nThe audit looks at the following areas: \r\n\r\nStructures: are the nationally recommended care structures in place for the management of diabetic foot disease? \r\n\r\nProcesses: does the treatment of active diabetic foot disease comply with nationally recommended guidance? \r\n\r\nOutcomes: are the outcomes of diabetic foot disease optimised? \r\n\r\nWhat period does the data cover? \r\n\r\nThis data covers patients first seen with a diabetic foot ulcer by a specialist foot team between 14 July 2014 and 31 March 2017. This National Report was published on 14 March 2018.",
