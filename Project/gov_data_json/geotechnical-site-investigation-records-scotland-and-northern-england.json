        "notes": "The collection of over 19,000 site investigation reports for Scotland and Northern England consists of records of boreholes, trial pits, geotechnical results and interpretative reports acquired from various sources. The collection started c.1960 to cater for the increasing amount of post-war shallow drilling for building and road construction which was kept separately by the Survey from the Borehole Journal collection reserved for deeper geologist examined mineral bores. The site investigation reports are available for consultation on microfilm. Only the factual parts of reports are available for public inspection. Reports for Northern England are held in the Shallow Borehole File (SB), now no longer added to. All site investigation reports (except SB files) are indexed on the Land Survey Record Index (LSRI) and all boreholes and trial pits contained in the reports (those with adequate site plans) are indexed on the Single Onshore Borehole Index (SOBI).",
