Some LSOAs had further adjustments resulting from the ONS Longitudinal and Local Authority studies, an under/over estimation investigation, a review of armed forces and prisoner counts, and changes in postcode to LSOA allocations.\r\nGuidelines: The datasets in this series contain new variables to improve usability. These variables include: Working age population totals and percentages, for males and females; Percentages of population in each quinary age band; and consistent LA and regional estimates. The Working age population is something that is widely used in relation to benefits data. The age distribution of the population in small areas can give clues to the types of deprivation issues it may face.",
