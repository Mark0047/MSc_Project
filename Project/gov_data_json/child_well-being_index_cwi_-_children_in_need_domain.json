It was therefore decided to model this indicator on the basis of information available for the authorities where data was available. The domain reflects the expected rate of children in need in a given LSOA given other information about it. Through the use of regression analysis it was found that 32 per cent of the variation of children in need under 19, as a proportion of all children under 19, was explained by Income Deprivation Affecting Children (the Income Domain of the CWI), the Income and Employment Domains of the ID2007 and Education Domain of the CWI. This model was used to predict the proportion of children in need in all areas.",
