In addition the proportion of each of \nthese sediment components were combined to predict the likely sediment \nclassification as both a EUNIS habitat class and Folk class. These are also \navailable as raster tif files with an associated ArcGIS layer file indicating \nthe appropriate class for each raster value.\n\nA shape file of the Folk classification is also available.",
