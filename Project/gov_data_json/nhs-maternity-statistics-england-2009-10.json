        "notes": "Note: (10/12/2010) The Health and Social Care Information Centre initially published the Provider Level Analysis spreadsheet on 18/11/2010. Due to the suppression of small numbers it wasn't possible to calculate method of onset or delivery rates for all providers. Additional information has been added to tables C and D of the Provider Level Analysis allowing estimated rates to be presented. \r\n\r\nMaternity data The publication includes details of all deliveries taking place in NHS hospitals (in England) excluding home births and those taking place in independent sector hospitals. This includes a wide range of information such as details of how the baby was born (method of delivery), complications, birth weight and gestation. \r\n\r\nData for 2009-10 A number of revisions have been made to the size and the presentation of the 2009-10 NHS Maternity Statistics publication. These revisions are intended to bring the publication in line with the National Statistics code of practice and highlight data quality issues to stimulate improvement in the quality of HES maternity data submitted by NHS organisations. \r\n\r\nFor further details on the changes to the table numbers and locations see Appendix A of the maternity explanatory notes. \r\n\r\nThe 2009-10 NHS Maternity Statistics publication will include two downloadable excel files; \r\n\r\nNHS Maternity Statistics, 2009-10 33 tables and 3 graphs are now available in one excel workbook which includes data on the following; \r\n\r\n\u2022Place of delivery \u2022Person conducting delivery \u2022Anaesthetics \u2022Method of onset and method of delivery \u2022Episiotomy Antenatal/postnatal stay \u2022Complications \u2022Gestation \u2022Birth weight \u2022Miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy Provider level analysis, 2009-10 The purpose of the provider level analysis is to contribute to the improvement of both the quality and coverage of maternity data submitted to HES. It is hoped this will stimulate discussion and ultimately contribute to enhancements in patient care. \r\n\r\nThe provider level analysis provides information at National, strategic health authority, hospital provider and site level (where submitted) relating to: \r\n\r\n\u2022Gestation period in weeks at first antenatal assessment date \u2022Gestation length at delivery \u2022Method of onset of labour \u2022Method of delivery \u2022Person conducting delivery \u2022Place of delivery \u2022Selected maternity statistics \u2022Spontaneous deliveries with episiotomy \u2022Caesarean with postnatal stay 0-3 days \u2022Total caesarean with anaesthetics \u2022Unassisted deliveries",
