The \nsurvey collected video and still imagery at 64 locations across the area which \nhad previously been surveyed using a multibeam echosounder. The imagery \nconsists of imagery from the seabed to determine the physical characteristics \nand biological communities. Each station was comprised of two 5 minute tows, \nwith acquisition of continuous video data and still images approximately every \n15 seconds. Still images were collected using a Nikon D200 with a fish-eye \nlens. This dataset is a summary dataset showing the centre point for all \nstations. GPS data was collected by Cefas using portable GPS unit connected to \nArcGIS. Images are available in *.jpg format, video data in digital movie \nformat.",
