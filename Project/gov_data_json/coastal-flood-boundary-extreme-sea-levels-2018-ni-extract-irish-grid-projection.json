        "notes": "Extreme Sea Level values is part of Coastal Design/Extreme Sea Levels, a GIS dataset and supporting information providing design / extreme sea level and typical surge information around the coastline of the UK, including England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Isle of Man and Jersey. The information is relevant under present day (year 2018) conditions and does not account for future changes due to climate change, such as sea level rise. This is a specialist dataset which informs on work commenced around the coast ranging from coastal flood modelling, scheme design, strategic planning and flood risk assessments.  \r\n\r\nExtreme Sea Level values describes the extreme sea levels for 16 different annual probabilities of exceedance. Confidence levels relating to the 5% and 95% lower and upper bounds of confidence are included. Mean High Water Spring (MHWS) and Highest Astronomical Tide (HAT) predicted tide levels are also included in the dataset for some sites but may not be used for navigational purposes.  \r\n\r\nThis 2018 update to the Coastal Design Sea Levels dataset was carried out in partnership for the UK Coastal Flood Forecasting partnership, which includes the Environment Agency (EA), Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), Natural Resources Wales (NRW) and the Department for Infrastructure Northern Ireland (DfINI).  \r\n\r\nThe main project outputs include:  \r\n\r\n-\tCoastal flood boundary conditions for the UK: technical summary report  \r\n\r\n-\tCoastal flood boundary conditions for the UK: user guide  \r\n\r\n-\tCoastal design sea levels \u2013 coastal flood boundary surge shapes (2018)  \r\n\r\n-\tGIS output in British National Grid projection  \r\n\r\nThe main project outputs are available at the UK open data portal \u2013 see link below  \r\n(https://data.gov.uk/dataset/73834283-7dc4-488a-9583-a920072d9a9d/coastal-design-sea-levels-coastal-flood-boundary-extreme-sea-levels-2018)  \r\n\r\nThe surge shape spreadsheet is also available at the link below \r\n(https://environment.data.gov.uk/dataset/84c97c5e-d465-11e4-afbd-f0def148f590) \r\n\r\nThis dataset is an extract from the overall UK wide project that contains GIS output covering Northern Ireland. For convenience, this GIS dataset has been re-projected to Irish Grid.  \r\n",

Digital NI aims to help establish a culture within Northern Ireland that develops and enhances Digital capability not just through interactions with Government, but also with local companies and throughout communities. Within government the Digital Transformation Service is facilitating this cultural shift through a number of methods, transforming Government services, making data open and available and encouraging and coaching those who lack digital skills.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that opening up our data is the right thing to do in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the Public Sector in Northern Ireland. It has the potential to encourage new commercial opportunities and drive economic growth and innovation across public and private sectors.",
