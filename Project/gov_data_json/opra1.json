A new record has been created with compliance rating data called Compliance Ratings (Waste and Installations) which will hold this data from 2014 onwards.\n\nThe datasets available are for 2014 to 2017 full Opra profiles and the 2015 to 2017 Opra compliance ratings from the resource links.\n\nOpra (Operational Risk Appraisals) covers industrial process installations and waste operations.  Opra scores categorise the environmental risk of installations and waste operations by assessing them on the basis of\n- Complexity (A-E) \n- Emissions and inputs (A-E)\n- Location (A-E)\n- Operator performance (A-E)\n- Compliance (calculated annually) (A-F)\n\nA being the lowest risk category. E/F being the highest risk category.  Total risk is a numeric score calculated by summing the five attributes. Attribution statement: \u00a9 Environment Agency copyright and/or database right 2018.
