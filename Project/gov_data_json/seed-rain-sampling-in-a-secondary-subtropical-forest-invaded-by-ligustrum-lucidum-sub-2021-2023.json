        "notes": "[This dataset is embargoed until November 10, 2025]. The data resource consists of two years of seed rain data for woody plant species in invaded subtropical mountain forests (Yungas). The forests were in the Horco Molle Experimental Reserve and Parque Sierra de San Javier (Horco Molle), Tucum\u00e1n, Argentina. The data are collected as part of an experiment to investigate the effects of management control of the invasion of the non-native species Ligustrum lucidum on the dynamics of the woody community. The experiments ran from June 2020 to November 2023. Every two weeks, fallen fruits and seeds were collected in fixed traps (surface 0.25 m2 each) located along transects within forest permanent plots. Each permanent plot (240 metres by 140 metres, 3.36 hectares for each plot) had four transects (160 metres long), and 12 traps were deployed within each transect. The placement of seed traps along the transects was informed by in silico experiments in which both the dispersal and management of L. lucidum were simulated and the placement of traps along simulated transects. After simulating different trap placements, the design chosen provided the highest precision and closest fit to the simulated dispersal and management of L. lucidum. After collection, the fruits and seeds were counted and identified at the lowest feasible taxonomic level (species level) in a laboratory using a stereo microscope. Also recorded was if the fruit or seed had some evidence of having been digested by animals. The work was carried out as part of NERC grant NE/S011641/1 \"Optimising the long-term management of invasive species affecting biodiversity and the rural economy using adaptive management\".
