        "notes": "This report describes the results of surveys carried out around Lundy in 1978 and 1979. 50 sites were surveyed off the 13 km of coastline. Data collected in some surveys previous to 1978 have also been used in compiling this report. Lists of species present and the main habitats observed are presented. The distribution of species on rock in relation to depth is described and the main features noted. The distribution of habitats and species around Lundy is brought about by mainly by the influence of wave action and tidal streams which vary widely around the island. 29 species present around Lundy are listed as rare or unusual in the context of the sublittoral ecosystems in the British Isles. Many of these species were present in large numbers at some locations around Lundy. Within the context of the SWBSS, Lundy is considered to be the richest and most scientifically interesting area studied. It is suggested that further work on sublittoral ecosystems at Lundy should be mainly concerned with data consolidation for the wide range of studies carried out in recent years. However, a programme of work aimed at establishing sites surveillance of change and initiating a programme of recording is suggested as the next stage of work. Records currently considered sensitive have been removed from this dataset.",
