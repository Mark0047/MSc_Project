Notable trees, considered to have exceptional value to conservation, culture or the landscape, have also been recorded even though they might not meet the criteria above.\nThe information from the Exmoor Ancient Tree Hunt is being uploaded to the website of the national Ancient Tree Hunt. Here you are able to use an interactive map to see where ancient trees have been recorded.",
