The purpose was to collect data to investigate the magnetite content of modern sands and silts around the Mull plutonic centre. Sample data were collected by divers, jar sample and a 0.5m core. Sites were controlled by echo-sounder traverses and positions were fixed by sextant from shore. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in IGS report 73/14.",
