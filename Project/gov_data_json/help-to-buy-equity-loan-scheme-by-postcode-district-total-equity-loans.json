        "notes": "This data set contains Help to Buy: Equity Loan statistics at postcode district level. For data released from 5 March 2015 onwards, the Homes and Community Agency (HCA) have revised the completion date for the entire Help to Buy Equity Loan time series. The HCA have stopped counting payment date (when the money out is paid out by the HCA) and now report on the expected actual completion date. It is more accurate and is closer to the live situation, especially when HCA now recognise an asset based on a completion, rather than exchange and approved claim. As a result (and due to reinstating accounts) HCA have seen movement of actual completions dates. There should not be this level of difference moving forward, it was a one off activity. The figures cover the launch of the scheme on 1 April 2013 until 30 September  2016.\n\nFigures have been attributed to an individual constituency by reconciling data against the ONS Postcode Directory (May 2014) where possible. Figures for some constituencies may be subject to revision later in the year.\r\n\r\nFor sales before 31 March 2014, properties are included under the local authority district to which they were initially allocated. In some cases, this differs from latest information, which forms the basis of the first column of local authority district figures. Figures for some local authorities may be subject to revisions later in the year. Although local authority information is validated against other geographic data at the time of data entry, detailed reconciliation of the data, conducted twice a year, may result in a small number of changes to these monthly releases, for example where a new development crosses a local authority boundary. \t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAn equity loan is Government financial assistance given to eligible applicants to purchase an eligible home through a Government equity mortgage secured on the home. The Government equity mortgage is ranked second in priority behind an owner\u2019s main mortgage lender. \r\n\r\nThis scheme offers up to 20 per cent of the value as Government assistance to purchasers buying a new build home. The buyer must provide a cash deposit of at least 5 per cent and a main mortgage lender must provide a loan of at least 75 per cent. \r\n\r\nThe Government assistance to buy is made through an equity loan made by the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) to the purchaser. \r\n\r\nHelp to Buy equity loans are only available on new build homes and the maximum purchase price is \u00a3600,000. Equity loan assistance for purchasers is paid via house builders registered with the HCA to participate in the Help to Buy equity loan initiative. The payment is made to builders (via solicitors) at purchaser legal completion. \r\n\r\nThe equity loan is provided without fees for the first five years of ownership. \r\n\r\nThe property title is held by the home owner who can therefore sell their home at any time and upon sale should provide the government the value of the same equity share of the property when it is sold.\r\n\r\nFor further information see  \r\n[Help to Buy (equity loan) scheme monthly statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/help-to-buy-equity-loan-scheme-monthly-statistics).\r\n",
