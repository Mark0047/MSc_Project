        "notes": "This work was carried out as part of the Fisheries Science Partnership (FSP) \nprogramme. The fishing vessel *Imogen 3* PZ 110 was chartered to undertake \nthe trials in the South West of England otter trawl fishery in August and \nSeptember 2018. Eleven days of fishing trials were conducted in ICES area \nVIIE, statistical rectangles 28E3 and 28E4, with a total of 27 hauls \ncompleted, 25 of these were considered valid for examination. The specific \nobjective of this trial was to investigate the operation and profitability of \na semi\u2010pelagic trawl towed higher in the water column to catch non\u2010quota \nspecies. It was thought that John Dory (*Zeus faber*), Hake (*Merluccius \nmerluccius*), Black Seabream (*Spondyliosoma cantharus*), Cuttlefish (\n*Sepia officinalis*) and Squid (*Loligo forbesi *& *Loligo vulgaris*) \ncould be caught in greater quantities than when using a demersal trawl.",
