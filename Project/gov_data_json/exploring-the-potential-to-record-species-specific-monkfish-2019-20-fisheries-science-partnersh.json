        "notes": "This work was carried out as part of the Fisheries Science Partnership (FSP) \nprogramme. Commercial landings of monkfish into UK ports consist of the two \nspecies, *Lophius piscatorius* and *Lophius budegassa*, mixed together. \nAs there is no EU or UK requirement to report, land, or market the two species \nseparately, this places a limit on the quantity of data that can be generated \non catch distributions and size composition for the individual species, with \nthe result that stock assessments are weakened, and management advice for \nmonkfish issued by ICES is precautionary. This project looked at the \npossibility of introducing changes to normal working practices of the fishing \nindustry in SW England that would improve the data available for the \nindividual species.\n\nAs part of completing electronic logbooks participating vessels recorded the \ntotal weight of monkfish caught on a daily basis together with ICES Rectangle \nfished.",
