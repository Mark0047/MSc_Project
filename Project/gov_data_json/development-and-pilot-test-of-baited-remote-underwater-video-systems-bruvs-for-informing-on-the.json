        "notes": "Trawl surveys routinely conducted by Cefas under-sample some of the larger \npiscivorous fish species, which are often either of commercial and/or \nconservation interest. Additionally, some habitats cannot be sampled \neffectively with trawls (e.g. reef habitats, deep-water areas etc), and other \ngears (e.g. longline) cannot be deployed safely from Cefas Endeavour. Baited \nRemote Underwater Video Systems (BRUVS) provide an alternative, non-lethal \nmethod for sampling such fish, and have been widely used in the Southern \nhemisphere to monitor fish assemblages in certain habitats. Over the course of \nthis project (Jan 2012 - Jan 2014), 18 deployments with BRUVS were made, with \na total of 37 hours, 23 mins recording time.",
