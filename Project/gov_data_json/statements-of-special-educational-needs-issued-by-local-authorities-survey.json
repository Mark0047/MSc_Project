It is collected from all Local Authorities in England and is an aggregate return. This is different from the data on number of pupils with statements in schools - which is collected as part of the school census. It is the only source of data on statements issued by individual Local Authorities.  It covers educational arrangements for children whom the authority maintains a statement of Special Educational Needs as well as assessments and placements by the authority.\r\nThe Special Educational Needs2 survey is an annual survey, which is collected in January each year collecting snapshot data on the position as at the census date, as well as information relating to the previous calendar year.",
