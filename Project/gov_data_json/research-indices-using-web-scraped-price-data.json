ONS has been conducting research into these technologies and, since May 2014, has been scraping prices from the websites of three retailers. Last year, ONS released two updates that constructed experimental price indices from the data. In this release, we provide updates to the experimental indices, and an analysis of the different methods used to clean and classify the data.",
