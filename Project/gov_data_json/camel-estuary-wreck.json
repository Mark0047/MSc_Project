        "notes": "This project presents the results of the emergency recording and undesignated site assessment of the possible wreck of the barque Antoinette, Camel Estuary, Padstow, Cornwall carried out by Historic Environment, Cornwall Council and maritime archaeologist Kevin Camidge for English Heritage in 2010.\n     The wreck had been exposed early in 2010 by shifting sands upon Town Bar at the entrance to the Camel Estuary, which is sited close to a navigational channel (NGR centred at SW 92650 75380). The Padstow Harbour Master proposed to remove the wreck as a hazard to shipping in the week commencing 1 March 2010; given the size of the remains, the use of explosives was proposed, along with the possibility of dismantling the wreck with a dredger-mounted crane and barge. Emergency recording of the wreck was therefore carried out on 28 February and a watching brief undertaken during demolition when some of the vessel's timbers were recovered and recorded.\n     The results of the emergency recording and the desk-based assessment indicate that there can be little doubt that the wreck is the middle part of the Canadian barque Antoinette. The Antoinette was wrecked on the Doom Bar on 2 January 1895 bound for Santos from Newport, Gwent with a cargo of coal. Part of the wreckage was carried by spring tides on to Town Bar where it became a hazard to fishermen and ferrymen and the remains became buried by sand following unsuccessful attempts at demolition using explosives.",
