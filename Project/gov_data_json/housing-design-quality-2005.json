The assessment is based on the Building for Life criteria. For each of the three Government Office regions, the top 10 house builders by volume were selected. For each top 10 house builder all schemes were completed between January 2002 and January 2005 and above 20 units. All developments were within an average house price bracket. Data for each housing scheme includes scheme name/address, local authority, housebuilder, number of units, context (urban, suburban etc), site type (greenfield/brownfield), scores for individual Building for Life criteria and total scores.\r\n",
