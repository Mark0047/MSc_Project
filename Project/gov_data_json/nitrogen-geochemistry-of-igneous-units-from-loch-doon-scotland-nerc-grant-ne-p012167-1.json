        "notes": "This dataset contains the nitrogen, oxygen, and lithophile element geochemistry of whole rock, and distribution coefficients, and stable isotope fractionation factors for biotite, orthoclase, and plagioclase mineral separates from the Loch Doon Zoned Pluton, Scotland. The samples were collected from the northern limb of the Loch Doon pluton and are petrologically classified as are granodiorites and granites which show geochemical evidence for being a cogenetic zoned pluton. The data were collected over a time period of 2019-2022. These data were collected to investigate elemental partitioning and stable isotope fractionation of nitrogen between biotite, plagioclase, and orthoclase relative to each other and to the system (whole rock) during magmatic differentiation. This project was curiosity-driven science, and the anticipated interest groups are assumed to be the wider research community via scholarship and analytical protocols. These data were collected by an international team of scientists as part of Dr Toby Boocock\u2019s PhD project.
