        "notes": "The data consist of soil physicochemical and biological data for three soil depths (0-15, 15-30 and 30-60 cm) from a winter wheat field experiment located at two research sites in the United Kingdom. Soil samples were collected between April 2017 and August 2017. Extractions and measurements were carried out thereafter. The sites were Rothamsted Research at North Wyke in Devon and Bangor University at Henfaes Research Station in North Wales. At each site measurements were taken from 15 plots, organised within a randomised complete block design where 5 plots did not receive fertilizers (controls), 5 plots received food-based digestate, and 5 plots received acidified food based digestate and the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole (DMPP; ADNI). Soil samples were taken within 2 weeks of digestate application and shortly before winter wheat harvest. Microbial community composition and nitrogen genes were measured on the same soil samples and are presented in a separate dataset (https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/id/391c0294-07f1-4856-b592-428bd44055ca). Soil samples were taken by members of staff from Centre of Ecology & Hydrology (Bangor), Bangor University, School of Environment, Natural Resources & Geography Sustainable Agricultural Sciences, and Rothamsted Research North Wyke. Measurements were carried out Rothamsted Research Harpenden and the Centre of Ecology & Hydrology (Wallingford). Data was collected for the Newton Fund project \u201cUK-China Virtual Joint Centre for Improved Nitrogen Agronomy\u201d. Funded by Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and NERC - Ref BB/N013468/1 Full details about this dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5285/90df9dfa-a0c8-4ead-a13d-0a0a13cda7ab",
