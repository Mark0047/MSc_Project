        "notes": "Amine atmospheric chemistry kinetic mechanism and related Gaussian 09 electronic structure outputs. A text document with a chemical kinetic reaction mechanism appropriate for the atmospheric chemistry of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) and piperazine (PIP). This consists of reactions of AMP and PIP with OH, NO2 and Cl considering the various possible hydrogen atom abstraction pathways available to each. These are considered the most important in the context of the likely atmospheric composition at sites where carbon dioxide amine based capture technology would be deployed. For completeness, additional reactions are reported of AMP and PIP with N2O3 leading to their adduct with NO, reactions of AMP and PIP radicals with OH and reactions of the PIP adduct with oxygen and PIP adduct with NO2 each producing an Imine. For each reaction is reported the Gibbs activation energy and the resulting rate constant for atmospheric conditions. The word document gives a description of the methodology used in the Gaussian 09 electronic structure calculation software and the resulting outputs in terms of the constituent atom cartesian coordinates, electronic configuration and energy for 77 distinct configurations of chemical reactant, product, and the intermediate step between reactant and product.
