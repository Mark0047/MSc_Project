Only English data are presented in this dataset, which includes data from 58 Mental Health Trusts that submitted a total of 5,095 case notes.\r\n \r\nSample size:\r\nEach participating Trust was requested to submit a sample of a minimum of 100 cases for the audit of practice. Please note that \u2018not applicable\u2019 responses were excluded from the analysis of questions, which may affect the number of case notes included in the analysis of individual questions.\r\n",
