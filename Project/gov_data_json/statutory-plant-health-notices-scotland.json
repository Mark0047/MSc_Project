        "notes": "This layer shows the extent of Statutory Plant Health Notices (SPHN) issued by Scottish Forestry in Scotland. The SPHN extent defines the boundary within which the full conditions and biosecurity measures of the SPHN apply - for smaller woodlands this is usually the external boundary of the woodland. The layer includes both active notices and older ones which have expired. It includes SPHNs issued for any pests and diseases, although the majority are for Phytophthora ramorum.\n\nThe SPHN extent is usually a buffer from a confirmed infected site (250m for P. ramorum), but may exclude areas that do not contain relevant trees, or may be extended to logical boundaries on the ground, such as the edge of a forest block.  An SPHN is issued to the land owner, so the buffer zone from one infection could be split into multiple SPHNs if the extent covers multiple ownerships.  An SPHN is specific to one pest or disease, so if multiple infections are found in one area, multiple overlapping SPHNs will be issued, one for each pest or disease.\n\nThis layer contains SPHNs issued as long ago as 2010.  There have been changes to the reference number formats used and the details collected in that time, so not all attributes will be completed for all features.  This layer is not exhaustive and does not include some old, expired SPHNs, such as those for Chalara ash dieback.\n\nDataset Attributes:\n\nsphn_ref: SPHN reference number\nsphn_status: Status of the SPHN\npest_disease: Pest of Disease the SPHN is issued to target\nhost_1: Primary host species the pest or disease is found on\nhost_1_ha: Area, in hectares, covered by Host 1 within the SPHN extent\nhost_2: Second host species the pest or disease is found on\nhost_2_ha: Area, in hectares, covered by Host 2 within the SPHN extent\nhost_3: Third host species the pest or disease is found on\nhost_3_ha: Area, in hectares, covered by Host 3 within the SPHN extent\ndate_issued: Date the SPHN was issued\ndate_compliance: Date by which the works required by the SPHN must be completed, taking into account any extensions\ndate_1st_compliance: Original date by which the works required by the SPHN must be completed, when the SPHN was first issued\nreason_1st_compliance: Reason for the original (1st) compliance date\nextension number: Number of extensions that have been granted to compliance date\nreason_extension: Reason for extension of compliance date\ndate_sphn_expires: Date that the biosecurity conditions related to the SPHN expire\nconservancy: Scottish Forestry conservancy office dealing with the SPHN\nfls_land: Is the SPHN on land managed by Forestry and Land Scotland\npr_policy_zone: Is the SPHN within the Priority Action Zone or the Risk Reduction Zone for P. ramorum\npr_man_zone: Is the SPHN within the P. ramorum Management Zone, if applicable",
