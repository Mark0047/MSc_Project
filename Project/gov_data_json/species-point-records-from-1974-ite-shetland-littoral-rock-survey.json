        "notes": "Coastal Habitats - Physical Characteristics - Part 6.1: A set of non-selective regular sampling points on the coast of Shetland were investigated and this report gives a method to generalise from these to other points of interest using clearly repeatable criteria. The aim of this exercise was to `provide a classification of the Shetland coast using these criteria to provide a sampling and intellectual framework for describing the coastal biology of Shetland and as a basis for monitoring the effects of oil development`. Every intercept of the 1 km OS grid was used as a sample point. One hundred and six attributes in 17 different categories were used to determine the coastal type at 1723 sample points. Analysis of results was undertaken by Recipricol Averaging and Indicator Species Analysis. Eight coastal types were determined, described and mapped. There is a key to the 8 coastal types. Littoral Biota of Rocky Shores - Part 6.2: Eighty sites were surveyed. At each site, the abundance of species was recorded at stations established at vertical intervals of the tenth of the tidal range. In Part 1, results were analysed by Reciprocal Averaging and by Indicator Species Analysis. The latter analysis seperates shores into 8 groups which roughly corresponded to the distribution of shore communities in relation to wave exposure. Each group is described and distribution mapped. In Part 2, a description is given of the shores in each of the 8 map groups and a table showing occurrence of 126 species at each of the sites is presented. Reaches were chosen to obtain a representative sample of the various conditions on mainland and tended towards areas where a diverse fauna might be expected. Work was undertaken by staff from the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.",
