        "notes": "This marine multibeam and sampling survey took place in June 2006 in the area off Northen Ireland to Scoland on board the RV Corystes. The survey was carried out by the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) and was a contribution to the Mapping European Seabed Habitats (MESH) project (this MESH project was an EU INTERREG Project). The aim of the survey was 1) Conduct Multi-Beam Survey of N Channel Peaks; 2) Undertake Targeted Ground Truthing of; N Maidens Peak, Lacuna Bank, Shamrock Pinnacle and Stanton Banks. Sea floor bathymetry data were collected using a multibeam system. Seabed samples were collected using a Hammon Grab Sampler and seabed images were recorded using a Drop Video Camera. British Geological Survey (BGS) participated in the survey. The sample data are archived by BGS. For Multibeam data contact AFBI. Details of the survey are contained in the AFBI Report of Survey, available on BODC website https://www.bodc.ac.uk/resources/inventories/cruise_inventory/report/11588/.",
