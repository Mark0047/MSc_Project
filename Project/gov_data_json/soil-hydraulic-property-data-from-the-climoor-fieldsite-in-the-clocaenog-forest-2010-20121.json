        "notes": "[THIS DATASET HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN]. This dataset contains soil hydraulic measurement data from the Climoor field site in the Clocaenog forest, in North Wales. The collection contains five data sets. 1) soil bulk density (0-5 centimetre) and saturated water content. 2) Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity measured in the field at tensions of -2 and -6 centimetre using a mini disk infiltrometer. 3) Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity measured using a HYPROP (registered trademark) instrument, an instrument which determines the hydraulic properties of soil samples, on soil cores taken from the field plots. 4) Soil water release curves for wet soil corresponding to the hydraulic conductivity measurements made using a HYPROP in the laboratory on cores from the field. 5) Soil water release curve data for dry soil measured using a WP4 potentiometer. The dataset has been quality checked, and incorrect or missing values removed, data has not been infilled and not available (NA's) have been added where there is no data. Data was collected between the end of 2010 and early 2012. Data sets 1, 3 and 4 were collected in April and September, 2011, data set 2 in May, 2012 and data set 5 in November, 2010. The Climoor field experiment intends to answer questions regarding the effects of warming and drought on ecosystem processes. The reported data were collected to monitor site specific soil properties at a specific reference time.
