        "notes": "[THIS DATASET HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN]. This dataset contains hourly micro-meteorological data from the experimental plots at the Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest, NE Wales. It runs from 11/9/2008 until 31/12/2013, and contains air temperature, soil temperature at two depths (5cm and 20cm) as well as soil moisture. Climoor is a climate change experiment which investigates the possible impact of increased temperatures and repeated summer drought on an Atlantic upland moorland. The experiment uses automatic roof technology to warm experimental plots by 0.5 - 1 degC and reproduces drought conditions in other experimental plots (July to September annually). In 2014, the Climoor experiment was the second longest running climate change experiment in the UK and data from the experiment has been used in several modelling exercises. The site was originally established under a EU consortium project - called CLIMOOR - where replica manipulation experiments were built in six European countries. As well as our site in North-East Wales (United Kingdom), there are identical sites in Denmark, the Netherlands, Sardinia (Italy) and Hungary. There was also a site in Catalonia (Spain).
