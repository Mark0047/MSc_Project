        "notes": "The FCA analyses the data, from 1 July 2022 to 30 September 2022, resulting from action it has taken against authorised firms breaching financial promotion rules and referrals, and investigations into unregulated activity.\r\n\r\nThe data the FCA gathers means it can monitor developments in the market, get insights into sectors it has concerns about and act to prevent consumers from harm.\r\n\r\nThe latest data shows the FCA reviewed 340 financial adverts relating to authorised firms, and its engagement resulted in 4,151 promotions being amended or withdrawn. Retail lending (with 46%), retail investments and retail banking are the sectors with the highest amend/withdraw outcomes, amounting to 95% of the FCA's interventions with authorised firms. ",
