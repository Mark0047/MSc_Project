        "notes": "The excel file contains unit, regional and national level data obtained from the 2014-15 National Paediatric Diabetes Audit.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, it includes information on patient characteristics, completion of health checks and outcomes achieved (as recommended by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence) for infants, children and young people with type 1 diabetes, under the age of 25, who attended paediatric diabetes units in England and Wales between 1 April 2014 and the 31 March 2015. \r\n\r\nData are included for the seven key health checks: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Glycated Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) \r\n\r\n\u2022 Body Mass Index (BMI)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Cholesterol\r\n\r\n\u2022 Blood pressure \r\n\r\n\u2022 Urinary albumin \r\n\r\n\u2022 Foot examination \r\n\r\n\u2022 Eye screening\r\n\r\nData on other health checks include: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Psychological support \r\n\r\n\u2022 Structured Education  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Screening for autoimmune disease (coeliac and thyroid disease)\r\n\r\nData on outcomes of care include:  \r\n\r\n\u2022 HbA1c target measurements\r\n\r\n\u2022 Small vessel (microvascular) disease\r\n\r\n\u2022 Large vessel (macrovascular) disease\r\n\r\n\u2022 Autoimmune disease (coeliac and thyroid disease)\r\n\r\nThe data were first published in May 2016 alongside the National Paediatric Diabetes Audit Report 2014-15. Data suppressed due to small numbers (<5). \r\n\r\nNB: Due to data corruption of ethnicity data submitted, this 2014-15 report does not include ethnicity data for patients in individual units for comparison across units regionally and nationally. Ethnicity has therefore not been used as a variable in the HbA1c case-mix adjustments.\r\n\r\nFor further information and details on the audit please refer to:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Supporting documents (see below): link to National Paediatric Diabetes Audit Report 2014-15\r\n\r\n\u2022 NPDA results online: http://npda-results.rcpch.ac.uk/default.aspx\r\n\r\n\u2022 The RCPCH website: https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/work-we-do/quality-improvement-patient-safety/national-paediatrics-diabetes-audit\r\n",
