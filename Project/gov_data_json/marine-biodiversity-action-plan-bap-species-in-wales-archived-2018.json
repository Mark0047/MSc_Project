        "notes": "This archived dataset consists of 32 datasets, and has been superseded by Environment (Wales) Act Section 7: Marine Species as part of the newer legislative requirements. This dataset is associated with the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP) which was published back in 1994, and was the UK Governments response to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which the UK signed up to in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro. Similarly under Section 42 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act (applicable to England and Wales) 2006, it is required that a 'list of the living organisms and types of habitat which in the Assembly's opinion are of principal importance for the purpose of conserving biodiversity'. The NERC Act in Wales, is being superseded by the Environm\nent Act (Wales) 2016. Under Section 7 of the Environment Act (Wales) These datasets will provide a basis on which to create a biodiversity list to meet the requirements of the Environment Act (Wales) set out under Section 6 and 7, which require biodiversity and resilience of ecosystem duty, and biodiversity lists and duty to take steps to maintain and enhance biodiversity are required, respectively. This includes the publishing of a list of living organisms of principle importance in Wales, for the purpose of maintaining and enhancing biodiversity in relation to Wales. These datasets will contribute towards the identification of marine organisms of principle importance in Wales, and will be kept under review in order to keep the list up-to-date as per Section 7 of the Environment Act (Wale\ns).",
