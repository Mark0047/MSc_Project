A description is provided in the Methodology Document. \r\n\r\nThe methodology uses the latest ONS sub-national population projections and incorporates information from the\r\nCensus 2011 on household population and numbers down to local authority level and household\r\nformation rates at a national level.\r\n\r\nAs with the previous projections, the methodology is split into two stages: Stage One produces\r\nsummary household numbers based on long-term demographic trends and Stage Two gives a\r\nmore detailed breakdown of household type.\r\n\r\nThe assumptions underlying national household and population projections are based on\r\ndemographic trends. They are not forecasts as, for example, they do not attempt to predict the\r\nimpact of future Government policies, changing economic circumstances or other factors that\r\nmight influence household growth. \r\n\r\nThe projections show the household numbers that would result\r\nif the assumptions based in previous demographic trends in the population and rates of household\r\nformation were to be realised in practice.",
