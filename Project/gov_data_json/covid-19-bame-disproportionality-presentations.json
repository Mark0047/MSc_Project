        "notes": "Unequal impact of COVID-19: BAME disproportionality\nWith the whole country and world waking up to the deeply entrenched structural equalities that have impacted the lives of our Black, Asian and other ethnic Minority communities, there is a collective appreciation that we need to go further to dismantle a system, and create new ones. \nLocal and national evidence shows that people from a Black, Asian or minority ethnic background are disproportionately impacted by Covid-19. \nIn response to this, the council implemented this working group to carry out a rapid 6-week programme to gather evidence of the impacts of Covid-19 and develop actions for supporting our residents during this time and beyond. \nIntensive work has been underway to understand and take action to address the direct and indirect health impacts of Covid-19 on our Black, Asian and other Ethnic Minority communities in Camden, and to ensure that individuals and communities are protected both now and through the next phase of the pandemic, but also to bring about wider systemic change. \nThis document is us working in the open with you and shows the information that was provided by different service areas to the member-led working group for comment and to develop actions going forward.\nThe Black, Asian and other Ethnic Minority Inequalities and Covid-19 Working Group has benefitted from evidence and the lived experience of our residents, VCS partners, professionals and Members in guiding and shaping the Council\u2019s response from bureaucratic to relational.\nIn this document you will find summaries of the data included in these presentation slides and the relevant links to documents.",
