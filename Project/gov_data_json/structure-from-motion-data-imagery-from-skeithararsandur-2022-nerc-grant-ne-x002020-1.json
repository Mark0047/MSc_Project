        "notes": "This dataset comprises approximately 18600 nadir images taken from a UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems) and saved as .jpg files. The dataset broadly covers the area of proximal Skei\u00f0ar\u00e1rsandur area (~63.9 N, 17.3 W), and Skei\u00f0ar\u00e1rsandur coastline (63.7 N, 17.5 W) at the mouth of G\u00edgjukv\u00edsl on 18th April 2022 in Southern Iceland. The data set broadly stretches for an area 11 km east, and 8 km north in the proximal Skei\u00f0ar\u00e1rsandur area. The coverage is variable as the imagery is centred on the proglacial lakes and associated drainage rivers. Data was collected over two field campaigns after the December 2021 Glacial Lake Outburst Flood, with collections occurring in April and June 2022. Flights were conducted at 120 m elevation with >60% overlap between images. Ground control points collected in the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System ) dataset were used to georeference the imagery. The images were collected to quantify the impacts of the flood and to try and identify strand lines and high water marks. Newcastle University was responsible for collection of the data.",
