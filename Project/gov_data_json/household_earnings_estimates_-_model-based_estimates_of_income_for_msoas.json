The estimates have been produced using a modelling methodology that enables survey data to be combined with Census and administrative data. The survey data used within the modelling process was obtained from the 2004/05 Family Resources Survey (FRS). The choice of the FRS enabled each of the four survey variables on income to be modelled. The estimates and confidence intervals produced are values of the average MSOA income for the following four income types: 1) Average weekly household total income (unequivalised). 2) Average weekly household net income (unequivalised). 3) Average weekly household net income before housing costs (equivalised). 4) Average weekly household net income after housing costs (equivalised).\r\nSource: Office for National Statistics (ONS)\r\nPublisher: Neighbourhood Statistics\r\nGeographies: Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA)\r\nGeographic coverage: England and Wales\r\nTime coverage: 2004/05, 2007/08\r\nType of data: Modelled data",

The estimates have been produced using a modelling methodology that enables survey data to be combined with census and administrative data to improve the quality of estimates at small area level. As the estimates are model-based they are different to standard direct estimates obtained from surveys and from statistics provided by administrative sources.  The model-based methodology has been developed to ensure that the ward estimates are constrained to the published Family Resources Survey (FRS) direct Government Office Region (GOR) estimates for England and the direct estimate for the country of Wales. For example, the model-based estimates for the wards in Wales aggregate to the FRS estimate of average weekly household income for Wales. However, the model-based estimates will not be consistent with FRS estimates of average weekly household income for other geographical levels. The methodology used to produce the model-based estimates is relatively new and as a result may be subject to consultation, modification and further development",
