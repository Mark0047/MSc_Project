Results are available according to gender, full or part-time working, industrial activity based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC2007) and location, subject to confidentiality constraints. \r\n\r\nThe BRES covers employee jobs only. It excludes agriculture (but includes animal husbandry service activities and hunting, trapping and game propagation), self employed, HM Armed Forces, private domestic servants, homeworkers, Jobskills trainees without a contract of employment (non-employed status). Figures for the number of employees in Agriculture are available separately from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) Agriculture Census. \r\n",

Digital NI aims to help establish a culture within Northern Ireland that develops and enhances Digital capability not just through interactions with Government, but also with local companies and throughout communities. Within government the Digital Transformation Service is facilitating this cultural shift through a number of methods, transforming Government services, making data open and available and encouraging and coaching those who lack digital skills.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that opening up our data is the right thing to do in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the Public Sector in Northern Ireland. It has the potential to encourage new commercial opportunities and drive economic growth and innovation across public and private sectors.",

However, in a small number of instances where employers were not able to provide figures by actual location, the employees were allocated to the address where pay records were held."
