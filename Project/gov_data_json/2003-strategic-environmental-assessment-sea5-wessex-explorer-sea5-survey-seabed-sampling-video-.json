        "notes": "As part of the Department of Trade and Industry's (now Department of Energy and Climate Change) Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA5) a geophysical survey was undertaken on Wessex Explorer as part of a geophysical survey and seabed sampling on shallow sand bank areas in the Southern North Sea off the Norfolk Coast; in particular Race Bank, Docking Shoal and Ower Bank. Multibeam and sidescan sonar data were collected.\n\nThe survey comprised seabed sampling, video and geophysical survey on shallow sand bank areas in the Southern North Sea off the Norfolk Coast; in particular Race Bank, Docking Shoal and Ower Bank. The survey objectives were to collect geophysical data, conduct quantitative seabed sampling and gather video footage of the seabed in the vicinity of selected sand banks with a view to better understanding the complex sediment transport processes at work in the area. An additional objective was to collect seabed samples and video footage for subsequent identification and assessment of benthic habitat.\n\n3 processed gridded multibeam files are available. Navigation and tide data and cruise reports are also available.",
