        "notes": "Between February and May of 1995 a series of plankton surveys were carried out \nin the Irish Sea by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture \nScience, and a number of partner research institutes, to undertake stock \nassessment by the egg production method. The species targetted were cod, sole \nand plaice. Ichthyoplankton samples were collected at each site on a planned \nsurvey grid. The data described here consists of the numbers of fish eggs and \nlarvae identified from the main net samples collected, along with associated \npositional and ancillary data and volumes filtered.\n\nIn addition, 69 main net samples were later analysed for mesozooplankton (12 \nto 16 samples from 5 of the cruises), and these data are also included.",
