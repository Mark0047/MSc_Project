This updates the provisional SFR released in October 2010 and contains revised national level analyses by school type, gender and subject and revised local authority level analyses by gender. Further tables are provided separately on the DfE statistics website only, including alternative local analyses, time series giving achievements in GCE A/AS level subjects, and achievements in GCE A level subjects by institution type and Local Authority.\r\n\r\nThe information in this SFR is based on data collated for the 2010 School and College (Key Stage 5) Performance Tables (formerly Achievement and Attainment Tables), which has now been checked by schools, and covers achievements in all Level 3 qualifications approved under Section 96 of the Learning and Skills Act (2000). The Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency (QCDA) tariff is used to calculate point scores for all Level 3 qualifications.\r\n",
