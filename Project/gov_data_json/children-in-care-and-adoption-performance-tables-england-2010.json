And we will be talking to local authorities and other partners about how the tables can be developed and extended. \r\n\r\nA table is provided for each of the indicators mainly based on a three year rolling average. Where available, data are provided for 2011, 2012, 2013. The only exceptions are the indicators on absence from school and schools performing below the floor target for which only two years and one year of data are available.\r\n\r\n",
