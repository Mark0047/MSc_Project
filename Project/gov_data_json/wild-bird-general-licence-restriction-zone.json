        "notes": "Special Areas of Conservation where trapping is not permitted under certain General Licences for wild birds. Relevant licences state whether this exclusion applies.\nIn 2019, changes are being introduced to how you can use some of the General Licences for managing problems caused by certain wild birds.  Licensing is an important tool for protecting wildlife whilst allowing necessary activities to take place.  The Wild Bird General Licence Restriction Zone indicates areas where trapping cannot be taken under certain general licences on Special Areas of Conservation. You can find out if this restriction applies to a specific general licence by referring to the conditions of the licence. If you need to carry out any licensable actions on land covered by this restriction then you will need to apply to Natural England for a separate licence. General licences are not a consent for the purposes of Part 2 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) in respect to SSSIs so it is your responsibility to get consent or assent if required before a licence can be used on any SSSI irrespective of whether it is covered by this restriction.\nThe data are intended for use only as a guide to help identify sites affected by a condition in a 2019 Wild Bird General Licence from Natural England and should not be relied on to indicate details of protected sites (this includes their designation, extent or features). The data are intended to be used in conjunction with the licence advice and other relevant information.\nData currently only available on Defra MAGIC Web Mapping application.
