        "notes": "A Yield Constraint Score (YCS; scale of 1-5) was developed for the effect of five key crop stresses (ozone, pests and diseases, soil nutrients, heat stress and aridity) on the production of the crops maize (Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa), soybean (Glycine max) and wheat (Triticum aestivum). Data are on a global scale at 1 deg by 1deg resolution, based on the distribution of production for each crop, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation\u2019s (FAO) Global Agro-Ecological Zones (GAEZ) crop production data for the year 2000. To derive the YCS for each crop stress, spatial data on a global scale were gathered. Modelled ozone data (2010-2012) were derived from the EMEP MSC-W (European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme, Meteorological Synthesising Centre-West) chemical transport model (version 4.16). Pests and diseases data (2002-2004) were downloaded from a Centre for Agriculture and Biosciences International (CABI) database providing estimates for pre-harvest crop losses due to weeds, animal, pathogens and viruses, compiled from the literature. Soil nutrient classifications (for 2009, derived using soil attributes from the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD)) were downloaded from the GAEZ data portal. A heat stress index was calculated using daily temperature data (1990-2014) to determine whether the temperature within a 30-day thermal-sensitive period exceeded crop tolerance thresholds. Global Aridity Index data (1950-2000) were downloaded from the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research\u2019s Consortium for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI). The Yield Constraint Score provides an indication of where each stress is predicted to be affecting crop yield globally and the magnitude of the effect. The YCS data were developed as part of the NERC funded SUNRISE project and the National Capability Project NC-Air quality impacts on food security, ecosystems and health.
