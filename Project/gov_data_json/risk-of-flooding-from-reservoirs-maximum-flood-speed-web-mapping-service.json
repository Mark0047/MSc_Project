This is one of 3 available \"Risk of Flooding from Reservoirs\" Web Mapping Services; Maximum Flood Depth, Maximum Flood Extent, Maximum Flood Speed. \n\n. Simplified in this context refers to the fact that unlike the detailed product, individual reservoir flood map speeds are not shown separately, and one merged outline shows the maximum flood speeds for all reservoir flooding scenarios together.\n\nThis is a data layer showing a combined reservoir flood map for 2,092 Large Raised Reservoirs including attributed data. The data shows the maximum speed of flooding should reservoirs be breached, and although the location of each reservoir can be inferred they are not explicitly shown on the maps. The Reservoir Flood Map Maximum Flood Outline (Speed) in its simplified form is referred to externally as Risk of Flooding from Reservoirs \u2013 Maximum Flood Speed.\n\nThe Reservoir Flood Map Outline (Speed) shows the maximum flood speeds that might be expected if a reservoir were to fail and release the water it holds. Since this is a prediction of a credible worst case scenario, it\u2019s unlikely that any actual flooding would create speeds this high. These data are intended for emergency planning only and are not reliable for large scale flood risk assessments. \n\nPlease note that only flood maps for large reservoirs are displayed. Flood maps are not displayed for smaller reservoirs or for reservoirs commissioned after reservoir mapping began in spring 2009.\n\nInformation Warning:\nOnly the Maximum extent, velocity and depth categories are available under the standard OGL terms when supplied as a WMS.
