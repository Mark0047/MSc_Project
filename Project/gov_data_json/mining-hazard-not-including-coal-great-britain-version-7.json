        "notes": "Underground extraction of minerals and rocks has taken place in Great Britain for more than 5000 years. The dataset draws together a range of diverse information; the geology, the primary constraint on distribution; additional information sourced from published literature and knowledge from BGS experts. Areas of known underground mining are identified with an indication of the level of hazard associated for each site. The presence of former underground workings, particularly where shallow, may collapse, causing surface settlement or subsidence. The type of material mined, age and extent of working (where known) is used to assess and classify the hazard at each site. The value is based on an A (mining is not known to have occurred) to E (evidence of extensive underground mining is known) scale. Mining Hazard (not including coal) covers areas of known underground working in Great Britain. The coverage is not comprehensive as areas with no evidence of underground working are not included in the data. The dataset was created to provide a comprehensive overview of Great Britain's long and complicated mining legacy. It provides essential information for planners and developers working in areas where former underground mine workings may have occurred. Also for anyone involved in the ownership or management of property, including developers, householders and local government.",
