        "notes": "This dataset consists of sentences extracted from BGS memoirs, technical reports, onshore hydrocarbons well reports and Mineral Reconnaisance Programme reports. The sentences have been annotated to enable the dataset to be used as labelled training data for a Named Entity Recognition model and Entity Relation Extraction model, both of which are Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that assist with extracting structured data from unstructured text. The entities of interest are rock formations, geological ages, rock types, physical properties and locations, with inter-relations such as \"overlies\", \"observedIn\". The data can be used to fine tune a pre-trained large language model using transfer learning, to create a model that can be used in inference mode to automatically create the labels, thereby creating structured data useful for geological modelling and subsurface characterisation. The data is provided in \"JSONL(Relation)\" format which is the export format from doccano open source text annotation software (https://doccano.github.io/doccano/) used to create the labels, and an alternative jsonlines format used by open source model training software https://github.com/princeton-nlp/PURE The source documents are already publicly available, but some only in pdf image form. The dataset is currently a proof of concept, and of insufficient volume to build a performant model. The development of this training data and the text processing scripts were supported by a grant from UK Government Office for Technology Transfer (GOTT) Knowledge Asset Grant Fund Project 10083604",
