        "notes": "This marine geophysical and sampling survey took place in June-August 1996 on the Continental slope West of Shetland on board the RSS Charles Darwin. The purpose was to undertake an integrated baseline environmental survey of the continetal slope west of Shetland undertaken on behalf of the Atlantic Frontier Environmental Network. Sea floor data were collected using a TOBI sidescan sonar and echosounder. Seabed sample data were gathered by using a multicorer, box corer, kasten corer and day grab also photographic seafloor reconnaissance of the seafloor using the SOC WASP system. A British Geological Survey geologist was onboard to undertake geological descriptions, the data from which is archived at BGS. For any other data from this survey contact National Oceanography Centre. Technical details of the survey are contained in SOC Cruise Reports 6 & 7.",
