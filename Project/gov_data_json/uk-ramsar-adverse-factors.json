        "notes": "Ramsar sites are wetlands of international importance designated under the Ramsar Convention. This dataset contains details for all broad wetland types for all designated Ramsar sites within the UK and its Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies. The dataset lists adverse factors relevent to the site as identified on the Ramsar Informaoin Sheet compiled for each site.  This dataset contains summary information on significant natural or human-caused factors which have been adversely affecting Ramsar sites, and any measures being taken to address these issues, as reported to the Ramsar Secretariat. This information is sourced from the latest Ramsar UK National Report. Note that some minor factors may not be listed. The worksheet also includes Adverse factors reported previously, but which are not considered to be operating at present, or which have been addressed effectively. This information is mainly sourced from the previous Ramsar UK National Report to the 9th Conference of Parties (2005). The data have not been updated since 2005 except in cases of new site designations (of which there are fewer than 10 since 2005 as at April 2016). \nExplanation of reporting category column:\n1. Those factors that are still operating, but it is unclear if they are under control, as there is a lag in showing the\nmanagement or regulatory regime to be successful.\n2. Those factors that are not currently being managed, or where the regulatory regime appears to have been ineffective so\nfar.\nNA = Not Applicable because no factors have been reported. \nFor category 2 factors - conservation measures taken to deal with the issue are described.",
