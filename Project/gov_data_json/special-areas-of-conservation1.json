They have been designated because of a possible threat to the special habitats or species which they contain and to provide increased protection to a variety of animals, plants, and habitats of importance to biodiversity both on a national and international scale. All of the SAC sites chosen under The Conservation (Natural Habitats, etc.) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1995 (as amended) are collectively known as the UK national site network which is a network of protected areas across the EU, which forms part of a wider international Emerald Network of Areas of Special Conservation Interest. The sites are chosen according to scientific criteria to ensure favourable conservation status of each habitat type and species. \u2018Favourable conservation status\u2019 means managing the site to ensure the special habitats and species are healthy.",

Digital NI aims to help establish a culture within Northern Ireland that develops and enhances Digital capability not just through interactions with Government, but also with local companies and throughout communities. Within government the Digital Transformation Service is facilitating this cultural shift through a number of methods, transforming Government services, making data open and available and encouraging and coaching those who lack digital skills.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that opening up our data is the right thing to do in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the Public Sector in Northern Ireland. It has the potential to encourage new commercial opportunities and drive economic growth and innovation across public and private sectors.",
