        "notes": "The National Coastal Erosion Risk shows the coastal baseline. This baseline is split to \u2018frontages\u2019. These are defined as lengths of coast with consistent characteristics based on the cliff behaviour characteristics and the defence characteristics. It is intended as an up-to-date and reliable benchmark dataset showing erosion extents and rates for three periods:\n\u2022\tShort Term (0 \u2013 20yr);\n\u2022\tMedium Term (20 \u2013 50yr); and\n\u2022\tLong Term (50 \u2013 100yr).\nFor the 5th, 50th and 95th percentile confidence levels for (All distances are cumulative over time and given in metres):\n\u2022\tNo Active Intervention Policy Scenario; and\n\u2022\tWith the implementation of Shoreline Management Plan 2 Policies.\nDefence type and SMP policies for each of the three periods described above are included.\n\nINFORMATION WARNINGS:\n1. The data and associated information is intended for guidance - it cannot provide details for individual properties. The NCERM information considers the predominant risk at the coast, although flooding and erosion processes are often linked, and data on erosion of foreshore features are, in general, not included.\n\n2. The data describes the upper and lower estimates of erosion risk at a particular location, within which the actual location of the coastline is expected to lie.  The data does not estimate the absolute location of the future coastline.  Details of geologically complex areas, known as \"complex cliffs\" are, in general, not included within the dataset due to the inherent uncertainties associated with predicting the timing and extent of erosion at these locations.\n\n\nThis dataset succeeds National Coastal Erosion Risk Mapping (NCERM) - National (2012 - 2017) Attribution statement: \u00a9 Environment Agency copyright and/or database right",
