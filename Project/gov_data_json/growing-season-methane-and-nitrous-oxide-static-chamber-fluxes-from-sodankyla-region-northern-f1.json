        "notes": "This dataset contains calculated terrestrial fluxes of methane and nitrous oxide using static chambers from the Sodankyl\u00e4 region of Northern Finland across both forest and wetland ecosystems. Measurements were carried out during growing season 2012 in two measurement campaigns (Summer: 12th July - 2nd August; Autumn: 22nd September - 14th October) using 60 static chambers (21 within the forest and 39 within the wetland). Fluxes were measured on approximately 2 day intervals resulting in a total of 10 measurements for all chambers during the summer campaign, and 7 for the forest and 8 for the wetland chambers during the autumn campaign. In addition to fluxes, auxiliary measurements include soil temperature, water table depth (wetland only), soil moisture (forest only) and soil respiration. The data was collected as part of the MAMM project (Methane and other greenhouse gases in the Arctic: Measurements, process studies and Modelling, http://arp.arctic.ac.uk/projects/) funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (grant NE/I029293/1) involving partners from CEH and the Finnish Meteorological Institute (Climate Change Research, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland).
