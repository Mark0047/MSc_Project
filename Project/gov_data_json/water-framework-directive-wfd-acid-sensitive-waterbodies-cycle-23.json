        "notes": "      Water Framework Directive (WFD) Acid Sensitive Waterbodies Cycle 2 (2014 - 2019) is a spatial (polygon shapefile) dataset containing attributes that have been collated as defined, for the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). To implement the guidance on managing forests in order to minimise adverse impacts in acid-sensitive areas, two categories of acid sensitivity have been identified. These are defined as 'failing due to acidification' and 'at risk of failing due to acidification'.\r\nWater bodies identified as currently 'failing' have been classified through the Water Framework Directive monitoring as being of less than 'good' status and the cause of that failure has been attributed to acidification. The 'at risk of failing' water bodies have been identified, via the findings of the Welsh acidification risk assessment, as being at risk of failing to achieve 'good' status by 2027, due to acid deposition. The risk assessment combines chemical and biological data and an assessment of the environment's ability to neutralise the predicted acid pollutants.\r\n    ",
