        "notes": "Devon Character Areas are areas of landscape in Devon that people recognise as distinct from others with a unique identity. They form one of the tiers of information within Devon's landscape character assessments. They replace the Devon Landscape Character Zones referred to in Devon Structure Plan policy CO1. 68 Devon Character Areas were identified as the third and final stage of Devon's landscape character assessment programme. They were defined by grouping together generic Landscape Character Types as far as possible, and their names and boundaries were tested through a consultation programme in 2011. Each Devon Character Area has a written profile including descriptions, evaluations, an overall landscape strategy and guidelines formulated through consultation with key stakeholders and using the results of a public survey. Landscape character assessments form part of the evidence base for local plans and provide guidance to help help balance the need for sustainable development with the need to sustain and enhance the distinctive character and special qualities and features of Devon's landscape.",
