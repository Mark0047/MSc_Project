        "notes": "This article describes the new RPIJ measure of Consumer Price Inflation. RPIJ is a Retail Prices Index (RPI) based measure that will use a geometric (Jevons) formula in place of one type of arithmetic formula (Carli). It is being launched in response to the National Statistician's conclusion that the RPI does not meet international standards due to the use of the Carli formula in its calculation. The accompanying Excel file includes a back series for RPIJ from 1997 to 2012.\n\nSource agency: Office for National Statistics\n\nDesignation: National Statistics\n\nLanguage: English\n\nAlternative title: New RPIJ measure of Consumer Price Inflation",
