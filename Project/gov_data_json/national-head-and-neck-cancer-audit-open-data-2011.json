The data are also being made available on the data.gov website. \r\n\r\nWhat information is being made available? \r\n\r\nAudit participation by NHS Trust and data completeness for the key fields. \r\n\r\nMeasures about the process of care given to patients. \r\n\r\nInformation about care outcomes and treatment. \r\n\r\nTrusts and Networks are identified by name and their national code. These data do not list individual patient information, nor do they contain any patient identifiable data. \r\n\r\nThe National Head and Neck Cancer Audit focuses on cancer sites within the head and neck (excluding tumours of the brain and thyroid cancers). The most common of which being the larynx and in the oral cavity. \r\n\r\nThe Head and Neck Cancer Audit Project is a high profile, collaborative, national clinical audit for bowel cancer run by The Health and Social Care Information Centre and developed in partnership with the British Association of Head and Neck Oncologists (BAHNO) \r\n\r\nThe audit aims to improve the quality of care and survival of patients with Head and Neck cancer. It meets the requirements as set out in the NHS Cancer Plan and NICE guidelines. \r\n\r\nThe Head and Neck Cancer Audit 2011 covers the time period from 1st November 2010 to 31st October 2011 and only Hospital sites within England are included in these csv files.",
