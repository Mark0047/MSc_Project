A new GMS Contract was introduced in April 2004 and a fundamental funding stream called the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) was introduced at that time.  QOF is a reward framework of indicators designed to remunerate general practices for providing good quality care to their patients.  An important feature of QOF is the maintenance of registers which allow prevalence of a number of long-term conditions to be calculated.  Register counts and prevalence per 1,000 GP registered population are published.  Where registers are age-specific, prevalence per 1,000 age-specific population are also published.",

Digital NI aims to help establish a culture within Northern Ireland that develops and enhances Digital capability not just through interactions with Government, but also with local companies and throughout communities. Within government the Digital Transformation Service is facilitating this cultural shift through a number of methods, transforming Government services, making data open and available and encouraging and coaching those who lack digital skills.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that opening up our data is the right thing to do in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the Public Sector in Northern Ireland. It has the potential to encourage new commercial opportunities and drive economic growth and innovation across public and private sectors.",
