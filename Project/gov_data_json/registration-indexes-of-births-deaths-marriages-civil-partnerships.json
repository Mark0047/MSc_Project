This obligation has been fulfilled since 1837 by the production of annual indexes initially on paper and latterly on microfiche. GRO made the indexes available for sale\u00a0between 1985\u00a0and 2006, facilitating web publication, but have been advised that the Registrar General does not have the remit to make indexes available in this way.\u00a0We recognise the potential benefits for our customers and stakeholders in having online access to civil registration information, but completing our digitisation of the records to achieve this would require significant investment. There are no current plans to resume this work but Her Majesty's Passport Office continues to monitor the scope for future opportunities to digitise birth, death and marriage records. "
