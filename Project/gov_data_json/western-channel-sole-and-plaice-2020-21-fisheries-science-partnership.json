        "notes": "One of the Fisheries Science Partnership (FSP) survey series of Western \nChannel sole and plaice. The survey\u2019s main aim is to show trends in the \ndistribution, abundance and age composition of sole (*Solea solea*) and \nplaice (*Pleuronectes platessa*), and to provide some information on bycatch \nspecies. At each station sampled, shot and haul, positional, depth and times \ninformation were recorded, and for all species of fish and shellfish length \ndistribution data were taken. Otoliths were collected from sole and plaice to \nprovide individual age at length information.Due to the 2020 COVID pandemic, \nthe commencement of the survey was delayed until November as it could not take \nplace at the time it usually occurs (August/September), and the collection of \nlength distribution data had to be restricted to sole and plaice only.",
