The purpose was to obtain the data necessary for a study of the estuarine geochemistry of the Mersey estuary. Sampling was undertaken using Environment Agency vessels; the hovercraft \u2018Sea Spray\u2019 was used May-July and September/October 2000 and May/June 2001; Sea Jet was used 15/16 February 2001 and RV Coastal Guardian, 8/9 February 2001. Seabed samples were obtained using a Day grab; Mackereth corer and manual beach surface sampling and hand coring. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS report RR/10/002.",
