Ove Arup & Partners Limited (Arup) and their partners Scottish Carbon Capture and Storage (SCCS) were commissioned in December 2009 by the European Commission Directorate-General Energy and Transport (DG-TREN) to undertake a feasibility study for Europe-wide CO2 infrastructures. The purpose of the study was to develop a complete and integrated database of European CO2 sinks and sources and identify the main outline of a CO2 transport infrastructure for different scenarios.
