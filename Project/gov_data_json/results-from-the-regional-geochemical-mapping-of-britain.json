The programme of regional geochemical sampling began in 1968 in the northern Highlands of Scotland. Sample sites are described on field slips. Chemical results are subjected to high level of quality control in the laboratory. Results are the raw data processed (standardisation and normalisation) to give seamless geochemical images and the value added G-BASE (Geochemical Baseline Survey of the Environment ) data in the BGS geochemistry database.",
