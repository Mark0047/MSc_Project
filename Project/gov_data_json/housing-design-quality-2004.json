        "notes": "An assessment of the design quality of 100 new housing schemes in London, the South East and the East of England. The assessment was carried out in 2004. The assessment is based on the Building for Life criteria. For each of the three Government Office regions, the top 10 house builders by volume were selected (based on most recent available data). For each top 10 house builder all schemes were completed between 1 Jan 2001 and 1 Jan 2004, over 20 units in size and of \u2018Average\u2019 Sales price. The attainable scores for each housing scheme varied from -48 (a \u2018Poor\u2019 standard scheme) to +48 (a \u2018Very Good\u2019 standard scheme). Each of the 16 audit criteria could receive a score of +3 to -3, which were added together to make up the total. Data for each housing scheme includes the housing scheme name, completion date, scores for individual criteria and total scores.\r\n",
