Where there is more than one family reference person in the household, the primary family is identified (usually the one containing the oldest full-time worker). Other families living in the same property are then counted identified as \u201cconcealed\u201d.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 13.33px;\">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) analyses concealed family types for each district, including the age group of the Family Reference Person.
