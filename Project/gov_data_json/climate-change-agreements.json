        "notes": "Details of current or terminated Climate Change Agreements (CCA) for the UK under the Climate Change Agreements (Administration Facilities) Regulations 2012. The Climate Change Agreement scheme has 51 sectors of various business types. Each sector has its own umbrella agreement which sets out improvement targets for each sector. A sub-sector is a practical method of partitioning within a sector such that the target units (Operators) in each sub-sector carry out the same or similar processes and/or have either all energy targets or all carbon targets. A trade association or other body may represent a sector of industry. Some sectors have set up (or plan to set up) subsidiary or separate organisations to represent them in the agreements. This sector/trade association will look after the management of all the operators which fall within their sector. For example a supermarket chain would be the Operator, each store which is eligible to be in the scheme would be a facility and all the facilities together would form a target unit. A target unit can just hold one facility or it may be a multi-facility target unit. The target unit holds an underlying agreement which sets out the targets that the target unit must meet. Eligibility to hold a CCA depends on the operator carrying out a listed \u2018eligible process\u2019. The CCA scheme runs from 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2023. Industrial operators that enter into and abide by the terms and conditions of their CCA are entitled to a discount on the Climate Change Levy (CCL), a tax added to electricity and fuel bills to encourage operators to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide they emit. Operators holding CCAs must monitor and report their energy consumption against agreed targets across four two-year target periods \u2013 each covering two calendar years \u2013 running from 2013 to 2020. At the end of each target period, operators meeting their targets will be certified to continue to receive the CCL discount. CCAs are voluntary agreements containing targets to increase energy efficiency and reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Facility and Target Unit addresses for 6 specific sectors are not released, for National Security/Site Security reasons. The sectors are NFU1 (Pigs), NFU5 (Eggs & Poultry Meat), BMPA (Meat), BPC1 (Poultry Meat), BPC2 (Poultry Meat Processing and Feed and DATC (Data Centres). Energy efficiency improvements and emission reductions data may not be included for some sites where a case for commercial confidentiality has been accepted.
