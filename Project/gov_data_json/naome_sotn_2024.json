        "notes": "The aim of the National Audit of Metastatic Breast Cancer (NAoMe) is to evaluate the patterns of care and outcomes for people with metastatic breast cancer in England and Wales, and to support services to improve the quality of care for these patients. This work builds on that of the National Audit of Breast Cancer in Older Patients (NABCOP ) but has been expanded to include younger people and men with breast cancer.\r\n\r\nThis State of the Nation report (SotN) publishes information on the care received by people diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer during 2019-21 in England and Wales. It is the audit\u2019s first annual assessment of NHS breast services and shares examples of good practice as well as highlighting where care needs to improve.\r\nThe SotN report includes performance indicators outlined in the NAoMe Quality Improvement Plan (QIP) . The QIP also sets out the audit scope, care pathway and five quality improvement (QI) goals.\r\n\r\nFindings in the SotN report lead to five recommendations highlighting where improvements in care are needed. These recommendations are aligned to the QI goals of the NAoMe.\r\n\r\nA Data Viewer provides results for individual organisations enabling regional and national comparisons to support local QI, in addition to an Action Plan Template to support MDT discussions.\r\n\r\nThe audit uses information that is routinely collected by the NHS. For people treated within English NHS hospitals, the data are routinely collated, maintained and quality-assured by the National Disease Registration Service (NDRS), which is part of NHS England. For people treated in Wales, the data were provided by the Wales Cancer Network (WCN) in Public Health Wales, from the Cancer Network Information System Cymru (CaNISC) electronic patient record system. A Methodology Document provides information on the data and methods used in this report.",
