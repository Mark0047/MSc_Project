This means that at present there is no single dataset which could be released. However,  work is currently underway to produce a microdata set for delivery to Eurostat, scheduled for September, and once finalised, this will be published on the  Visit England (VE)  website (subject to agreemeint by other sponsoring boards). VE will review formats of current deliverables (mainly pdf) to explore scope to additionally publish in other formats."
