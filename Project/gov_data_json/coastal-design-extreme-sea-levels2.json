This is a specialist dataset which informs on work commenced around the coast ranging from coastal flood modelling, scheme design, strategic planning and flood risk assessments. The dataset contains the following layer components:\n-  Extreme Sea Level Values: Extreme sea levels for a range of return periods\n-  Extreme Sea Level Confidence Level: Confidence intervals providing allowances for uncertainty\n-  Estuary Boundaries: Inland estuarine boundaries of the extreme sea levels\n-  Surge Shape Locations: Reference to surge shape appropriate for each Class A gauge site and where to apply it\n-  Tide Gauge Locations: Location of gauging stations",
