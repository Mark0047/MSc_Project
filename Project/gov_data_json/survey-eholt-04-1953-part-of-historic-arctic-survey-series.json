        "notes": "This survey was undertaken by Cefas as part of the Historic Arctic Survey \nSeries;\n\n*Gadus morhua* (Atlantic Cod) stocks in the Barents Sea are currently at \nlevels not seen since the 1950s. Causes for the population increase last \ncentury, and understanding of whether such large numbers will be maintained in \nthe future, are unclear. To explore this, we digitised and interrogated \nhistorical cod catch and diet datasets from the Barents Sea. Data includes \ntemporal and spatial information, cod catch data and length distributions, and \nhydrographic data.\n\nSurvey took place between 13/05/1953 and 04/06/1953 on Ernest Holt\n\nEquipment used during this survey :\n\n\n-   Engels trawl codend catch\n-   Otter Trawl 78ft Granton with shrimp netting cover\n\nSurvey operations were undertaken on 31 stations\n\n19 different species were caught on this survey",
