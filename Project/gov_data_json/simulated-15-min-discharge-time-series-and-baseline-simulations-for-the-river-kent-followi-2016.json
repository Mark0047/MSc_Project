        "notes": "Simulated 15-min discharge time-series (1/10/2015-17/1/2016) for the River Kent at Sedgwick following a Natural Flood Management intervention of \u2018Enhanced Hillslope Storage\u2019 plus the baseline simulations are presented. To derive these data, the observed 15-minute discharge River Kent measured at the Environment Agency (EA) Sedgwick gauging station (https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/73005) through the 1 Oct 2015 to 17 Jan 2016 period were modelled using the latest version of Lancaster University\u2019s Dynamic TOPMODEL (https://cran.r-project.org/web//packages/dynatop/index.html). The spatially distributed rainfall field used as input to TOPMODEL was derived from a new direction-dependent and topographically controlled interpolation using observed rainfall data for the Cumbrian Mountains (Page et al., 2022. Hydrological Processes 36: e14758, https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14758). Lack of perfect understanding of the hydrological processes routing rainfall for stream channels and then along stream channels to the Sedgwick gauge was represented by using a very wide range of model parameters applied randomly within 10,000 simulations. Using the approach detailed in Beven et al. (2022a. Hydrological Processes 36(10): e14703, https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14703), the resultant wide range of simulated discharge time-series was reduced by rejecting all but 67 simulations that passed the prescribed criteria. These 67 baseline simulations of observed behaviour through the +3 month period at Sedgwick are presented here. To represent the effect of adding surface storage distributed across this 209 sq km River Kent catchment, the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) used in the baseline simulations according to Hankin et al (2018. Technical report SC150005/R6. Environment Agency, Bristol. 77pp, https://www.gov.uk/flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-research-reports/working-with-natural-processes-to-reduce-flood-risk) to represent bunds placed on hillslopes in rural areas. The bunds are a type of flood mitigation measure known as Natural Flood Management or NFM. These are known formally as \u2018Enhanced Hillslope Storage\u2019 or EHS features (Beven et al 2022b. Hydrological Processes 36: e14752, https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14752). The TOPMODEL parameter sets producing the 67 \u2018acceptable\u2019 baseline simulations were then re-run with the modified DEM. These results are also presented here. Full details about this dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5285/af081a90-b014-43f7-9399-c948a8b7672f",
