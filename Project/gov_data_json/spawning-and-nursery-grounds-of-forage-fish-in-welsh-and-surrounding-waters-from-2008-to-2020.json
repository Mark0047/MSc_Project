        "notes": "The maps provide information on the location of spawning and nursery areas of \nseveral forage fish species in Welsh and surrounding waters, including the \nIrish and Celtic Seas and the western English Channel. The forage fish \npopulations inhabiting these waters provide a key source of prey for many \npredators, such as marine mammal and seabird species, including several of \nconservation concern, that either breed or overwinter in the study area. Given \nthat several forage fish species in the northeast Atlantic have shown major \nchanges in distribution and abundance, up-to-date information on their recent \ndistribution patterns is important, including on where the main nursery and \nspawning grounds are presently located. The maps are provided for eleven fish \nspecies that are prey to marine mammals and seabirds: herring, sprat, sardine, \nanchovy, sandeel, horse mackerel, mackerel and garfish as well as the gadoid \nspecies poor cod, whiting and cod. Using survey data from 2008 to 2020, \nhotspot maps were created for adults and juveniles of each of the species. \nData on most of the species was sparse and some of the gears used in fisheries \nsurveys were not designed to catch the target species. However, a hotspot \nmethodology allowed data from different gears to be standardised and combined \ninto a composite map which covered most of the study area during two periods \nof the year (Quarter 1 and Quarter 4). Maps largely corresponded to those \npreviously reported although several new species were included for which no or \nlimited historic maps were available, specifically sprat, poor cod and \ngarfish.",
