        "notes": "Making clinical audit data transparent \r\n \r\nIn his transparency and open data letter to Cabinet Ministers on 7 July 2011, the Prime Minister made a commitment to make clinical audit data available from the national audits within the National Clinical Audit and Patient Outcomes Programme. \r\n  \r\nWhat information is being made available? \r\n \r\nAudit participation by NHS Trust and data completeness for the key fields. \r\n \r\nMeasures of aspects of the care given to patients. \r\n \r\nInformation about care outcomes and treatment.\r\n\r\nThese data do not list individual patient information, nor do they contain any patient identifiable data. \r\n  \r\nThe National Head and Neck Cancer Audit focuses on cancer sites within the head and neck (excluding tumours of the brain and thyroid cancers). The most common of which are the larynx, oropharynx and in the oral cavity.\r\n \r\nThe National Head and Neck Cancer Audit is commissioned and sponsored by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP) and developed in partnership with the British Association of Head and Neck Oncologists (BAHNO). The Health and Social Care Information Centre provides project management and technical infrastructure.\r\n \r\nThe National Head and Neck Cancer Audit 2013, Ninth Annual Report provided information that represents 7,817 cases of head and neck cancer from England and 541 cases from Wales. The report, therefore, represents a comprehensive overview of head and neck cancer care, and this supporting dataset contains those England indicators in the main report and supplementary report files. \r\n\r\nAccessing the data\r\n\r\nEach year data from the National Head and Neck Cancer Audit will be made available in CSV format. The data are also being made available on the data.gov website. \r\n\r\nWhich level of data is being reported?\r\n\r\nTrusts and networks within England are included. \r\n\r\nTrusts and Networks are identified by name and their national code. \r\n\r\nWhat period does the data cover?\r\n\r\nThe National Head and Neck Cancer Audit 2012-2013 covers the time period from 1st November 2012 to 31st October 2013. \r\n",
