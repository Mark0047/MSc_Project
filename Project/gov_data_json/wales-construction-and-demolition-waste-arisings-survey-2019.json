        "notes": "      The purpose of the study was to provide information on the types, quantities, origins (by Construction and Demolition sector and geographic region), and fate (management method) of Construction and Demolition (C&D) wastes generated by businesses and the public sector in Wales in 2019. This is a stand-alone survey and supersedes the data from the last survey for the 2012 calendar year.\r\n This information is required for a variety of reasons including:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tstatutory reporting on waste generation in compliance with Part 2 of Schedule 1 of the Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2011 and, up until 2020, the EU Waste Statistics Regulations 2002;\r\n\u2022\tinforming the development of national waste policy;\r\n\u2022\tmonitoring progress against national waste prevention and recycling targets;\r\n\u2022\tinforming waste planners and the regulator;\r\n\u2022\tsupporting investment decisions such as the selection of the type and scale of new waste management facilities required by local authorities and the waste industry;\r\n\u2022\tupdating the evidence base for the State of Natural Resources Report Wales assessment (Natural Resources Wales 2021), and;\r\n\u2022\tproviding businesses with a better understanding of their current waste practices and for developing sustainable waste management support strategies by Welsh Government for improving environmental performance of businesses.\r\nThe precision for the total waste generated in Wales was +/- 16.7% at 90% confidence.\r\nResults from all surveys are subject to limitations with respect to the quality of estimates produced. Whilst these limitations do not alter the results or the statistical data, they should be borne in mind by users of the data.\r\nInformation on waste management in the report is generally reliable but the accuracy of the results is limited to information available to surveyed producers on the final destinations of their waste. The accuracy is limited owing to the complexities of waste management routes and difficulties linking final fate back to source.\r\nFurther information, including on the survey confidence, is contained in the published survey report. The detailed survey technical appendices are also available on request.\r\n    ",
