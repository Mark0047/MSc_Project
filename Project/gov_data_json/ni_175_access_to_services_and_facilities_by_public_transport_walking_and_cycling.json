Within Greater London, an indicator definition will be developed by Transport for London and finalised with Department for Transport by March 2008. The Department for Transport will finalise an indicator definition for the Isles of Scilly in discussion with the council. In metropolitan areas, the indicator should be reported at council level, but following the common definition approved in the relevant joint local transport plan",
