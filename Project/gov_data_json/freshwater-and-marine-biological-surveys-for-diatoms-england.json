As of March 2020 all data formerly available in 'Freshwater and Marine Biological Surveys for Diatoms England' is available from 'Freshwater river diatom surveys (Biosys)'. \nThe abstract below provides a historical reference for 'Freshwater and Marine Biological Surveys for Diatoms England' at the point of retirement.\n\nFreshwater and Marine Biological Surveys England.\nThe Environment Agency undertakes freshwater and marine biological monitoring in England. Freshwater and Marine Biological Surveys England is a large dataset containing taxonomic level species data for biological surveys carried out in freshwater and marine environments. Species surveys include:\n- Invertebrate, algal and macrophyte surveys in rivers and still waters;\n- Marine macro-invertebrate, algal, macrophyte and seagrass data.\n\nNote:\n\n- This archive is more commonly known as BIOSYS \n- This dataset contains Freshwater, River Diatom surveys only.\n- Pollution Samples are excluded from the dataset.\n-The majority of the calculations in this dataset were updated in 2017 to correct errors discovered in 2016. \n-The TDI3 calculations in this dataset have not been updated.  They display the value (which was correct) at the time the record was saved.  If taxon values and hierarchies have been updated since this date an updated value will not be generated.  As these values are used in a historic context they will not be updated in the future. Attribution statement: \u00a9 Environment Agency copyright and/or database right 2019. All rights reserved.",
