        "notes": "An estimate of the proportion and number of police recorded crimes committed by young people aged 10 to 17 in 2009/10. The approach used was to apply data on proven offending from the Police National Computer, which contains the key information on the age of proven offenders, to police recorded crime statistics. The analysis estimates that young people aged 10 to 17 were responsible for 23 per cent of police recorded crime in 2009/10, equivalent to just over a million police recorded crimes. This finding highlights the importance of tackling crime by young people in reducing overall levels of crime.",
