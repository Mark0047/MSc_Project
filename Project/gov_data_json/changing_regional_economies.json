Each report provides a profile of the relevant region and presents a range of statistics that help to understand differences between regions. Within regions, comparisons are made between sub-regions and between rural and urban areas. Regional statistics in the context of the European Structural Funds are discussed, followed by a look-ahead at the developments in regional statistics expected as a result of the Allsopp programme, three years since the original Allsopp Report.\n\nSource agency: Office for National Statistics\n\nDesignation: National Statistics\n\nLanguage: English\n\nAlternative title: Changing Regional Economies",
