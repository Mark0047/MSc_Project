        "notes": "A trial undertaken to evaluate the performance of a 120mm square mesh panel \n(SMP) recently regulated in the Celtic Sea for TR1 and TR2 otter trawlers. The \nuse of this gear modification has been mandatory in ICES areas VIIf, g and \nnorthern VIIj since 2015. The trial, commissioned and funded from the Defra \nFisheries Science Partnership programme to meet the UK commitments made at the \nEU December Council meetings in 2014, was to assess improvements in \nselectivity using the larger mesh SMP, particularly for haddock and cod, in \nthe context of the landing obligation, and to determine the potential economic \nconsequences of using this gear design.",
