A description is provided in the Methodology Document.\r\n\r\nThe methodology uses the latest ONS sub-national population projections and incorporates information from the Census 2011 on household population and numbers down to local authority level and household formation rates at a national level.\r\n\r\nAs with the previous projections, the methodology is split into two stages: Stage One produces summary household numbers based on long-term demographic trends and Stage Two gives a more detailed breakdown of household type.\r\n\r\nThe assumptions underlying national household and population projections are based on demographic trends. They are not forecasts as, for example, they do not attempt to predict the impact of future Government policies, changing economic circumstances or other factors that might influence household growth.\r\n\r\nThe projections show the household numbers that would result if the assumptions based in previous demographic trends in the population and rates of household formation were to be realised in practice.",
