The sites are part of the Clean Seas Environmental Monitoring Programme (CSEMP); a UK wide monitoring programme coordinated by the Clean, Safe Seas Evidence Group (CSSEG). The data generated is used to assess the status and trend of contaminants concentrations in sediment, and contributes to the UK's requirements under the Oslo and Paris Convention (OSPAR). Northern Ireland data has also been used in national assessments, such as Charting Progress 2, and to support the UK's 2018 assessments for Descriptor 8 of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). Monitoring sites are assigned to regions for reporting and assessment. Belfast Lough Inner, Belfast Lough Outer, Larne Lough, Strangford Lough and Carlingford Lough are in the Irish Sea. Lough Foyle and the Bann Estuary are in the Minches and Malin Sea (Irish and Scottish West Coast). The Irish Sea and Irish and Scottish West Coast are reported under OSPAR Region III. The sediment data used in the 2018 CSEMP assessment using data from MERMAN may be cited with the citation provided by Marine Scotland https://doi.org/10.7489/12227-1.",

Digital NI aims to help establish a culture within Northern Ireland that develops and enhances Digital capability not just through interactions with Government, but also with local companies and throughout communities. Within government the Digital Transformation Service is facilitating this cultural shift through a number of methods, transforming Government services, making data open and available and encouraging and coaching those who lack digital skills.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that opening up our data is the right thing to do in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the Public Sector in Northern Ireland. It has the potential to encourage new commercial opportunities and drive economic growth and innovation across public and private sectors.",
