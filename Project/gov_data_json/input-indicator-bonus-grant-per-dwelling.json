        "notes": "This is the Total New Homes Bonus grant payable for a financial year, divided by number of dwellings rewarded. Calculations are available separately for shire areas, metropolitan areas and London.\n\n#### How the figure is calculated:\r\n\r\nFor 2011-12: average grant payable in areas equals the total payment for increase in effective stock divided by the increase in the number of dwellings comprising the effective stock. Where the effective stock is defined as dwellings on the valuation list less recent demolitions less long-term empty homes. Growth in the effective stock is measured from October to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Why is this indicator in the business plan?\r\n\r\nIt is a measure of the financial reward for housing growth provided through the New Homes Bonus. This is a key DCLG policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How often is it updated?\r\n\r\nAnnually\r\n\r\n#### Where does the data come from?\r\n\r\nCouncil Tax Base returns. Published figures are available  [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government/series/council-taxbase-statistics). \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What area does the headline figure cover?\r\n\r\nEngland\r\n\r\n#### Are further breakdowns of the data available?\r\n\r\nYes, can be split by Housing Authority area.\r\n\r\n#### What does a change in this indicator show?\r\n\r\nAn increase in the average NHB grant payable may reflect an increase (i) in the proportion of homes receiving an affordable homes premium, (ii) a shift in distribution of homes awarded NHB at higher tax bands or (iii) an increase in the average national level of council tax for band D property (11 pence between 11/12 and 12/13).\r\n\r\n#### Time Lag\r\n\r\nFigures are published in advance of the financial year: initial figures in December and final figures in the February. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Next available update\r\n\r\nSpring 2013\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Type of Data\r\n\r\nOfficial Statistics\r\n\r\n#### Robustness and data limitations\r\n\r\nThe data used in calculating the New Homes Bonus are also used in calculating each local authority's Council Tax Base for Formula Grant purposes so this effectively ensures a 100% response rate before the release is compiled. Figures are subjected to rigorous pre-defined validation tests both within the form itself, while the form is being completed by the authority, and also in DCLG when the data are received and stored.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Links to Further Information\r\n\r\n[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-homes-bonus-final-scheme-design--2](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-homes-bonus-final-scheme-design--2)\r\n\r\n#### Contact Details\r\n\r\n[CorporatePerformance@communities.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:CorporatePerformance@communities.gsi.gov.uk)\r\n\r\n",
