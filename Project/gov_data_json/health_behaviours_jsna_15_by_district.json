        "notes": "In Lancashire there was limited information about the extent to which people engaged in health-compromising and health-enabling behaviours. To address this a project was commissioned to look at health behaviours in the county. Alongside a lifestyle questionnaire sent to 55,000+ households, a comprehensive data and evidence review was undertaken to look at the following:\r\n\u2022diet/nutrition;\r\n\u2022physical activity;\r\n\u2022tobacco/smoking;\r\n\u2022stress;\r\n\u2022drug use;\r\n\u2022alcohol; and\r\n\u2022sexual behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe findings have produced a wealth of intelligence, including the extent to which residents partake in the health behaviours above, and the charateristics of certain demographic groups around these.\r\n\r\nThis dataset includes the district level findings from lifestyle survey.",
