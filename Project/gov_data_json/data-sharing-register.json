The log is used to record, track and report on the various data sharing agreements made by the FSA with other organisations to share information compliantly. The reference numbers are not always consecutive as sometimes an initial data sharing enquiry does not result in setting up an agreement. The data sharing activity categories are:\r\n\u2022\tdisclosed  - data is shared one way only from FSA to the other party in the data sharing agreement \r\n\r\n\u2022\treceived -  data is shared one way only from the other party in the data sharing agreement to the FSA  \r\n\r\n\u2022\tboth - there is a mutual exchange of data between the FSA and the other party in the agreement\r\n",
