        "notes": "The [2014 London Business Survey](/london-business-survey-2014/) (LBS) is an innovative survey designed by the Office for National Statistics, on behalf of the London Enterprise Panel and the GLA. The survey collected information from a representative sample of private sector businesses in London in May-July 2014.\n\nThis dataset contains information on innovation activity and investments corresponding with Section 7 of the [London Business Survey 2014: Main Findings report.](http://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/business-and-economy/business-and-economy-publications/london-business-survey-2014)\n\nInformation is provided on:\n\n*   London businesses which are innovation active, by the type of innovation including product, process, marketing and organisational innovations\n    \n*   Investment in innovation by businesses by type of investment, including Research and Development (R&D), the purchase of licensing of patents and existing knowledge, the training of staff for innovative activities, and the acquisition of machinery, equipment and software\n    \n\nAs with any survey, the 2014 LBS is based on a sample and as such is subject to variability in the results. Care should therefore be taken in interpreting the survey findings. For all estimates, lower and upper limits of 95% confidence intervals are provided in the data files to assist with interpretation. The LBS results represent the population of business units in London. A business unit is defined as a site/workplace, which may also be a head office if the head office is in London. It will be the whole business in the case of businesses which only have one site, or part of the business in the case of multi-site firms.\n\nThe results are presented by enterprise size band and industry sector.",
