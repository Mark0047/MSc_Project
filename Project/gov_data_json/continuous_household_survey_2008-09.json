The CHS provides a regular source of information on a wide range of social and economic issues within Northern Ireland, and has been running since 1983.  The home care module was included in the CHS with a view to collecting information on the current ability of respondents to perform a number of selected activities and to ascertain if they had any help with these activities from a relative, friend or neighbour.  The opportunity was also used to find out if those requiring help had considered a home care package and to gather the views of any current home care service users about the service they receive.\n\nSource agency: Health, Social Service and Public Safety (Northern Ireland)\n\nDesignation: National Statistics\n\nLanguage: English\n\nAlternative title: CHS 2008/09 - Domiciliary Care Module",
