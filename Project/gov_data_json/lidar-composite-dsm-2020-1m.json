A new version of the data is available here: https://environment.data.gov.uk/dataset/9ba4d5ac-d596-445a-9056-dae3ddec0178\n\nThe LIDAR Composite DSM (Digital Surface Model) is a raster elevation model covering >88% of England at 1m spatial resolution.  \n\nProduced by the Environment Agency in 2020, this dataset is derived from a combination of our Time Stamped archive and National LIDAR Programme, which has been merged and re-sampled to give the best possible coverage. Where repeat surveys have been undertaken the newest, best resolution data is used. Where data was resampled a bilinear interpolation was used before being merged.  \n\nThe 2020 LIDAR Composite contains surveys undertaken between 6th June 2000 and 1st September 2020. Please refer to the survey index files which shows, for any location, what Time Stamped survey or National LIDAR Programme block went into the production of the LIDAR composite for a specific location. \n\nThe DSM (Digital Surface Model) is produced from the last return LIDAR signal and includes heights of objects, such as vehicles, buildings and vegetation, as well as the terrain surface. Available to download as ASCII files in 5km grids, data is presented in metres, referenced to Ordinance Survey Newlyn, using the OSTN\u201915 transformation. All LIDAR data has a vertical accuracy of +/-15cm RMSE. A tinted shaded relief, which is an image showing what LIDAR looks like when loaded into specialist software, is also available as a WMS feed. You can also download survey index files which shows, for any location, what Time Stamped survey went into the production of the LIDAR composite.\n\nLight Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) is an airborne mapping technique, which uses a laser to measure the distance between the aircraft and the ground. Up to 500,000 measurements per second are made of the ground, allowing highly detailed terrain models to be generated at spatial resolutions of between 25cm and 2 metres. The Environment Agency\u2019s open data LIDAR archives includes the Point Cloud data, and derived raster surface models of survey specific areas dating back to 1998 and composites of the best data available in any location. \n\nThis metadata record is for Approval for Access product AfA458.  \n\nAttribution statement: (c) Environment Agency copyright and/or database right 2021.
