        "notes": "In May 2018, Redcar & Cleveland Borough Council adopted the Redcar & Cleveland Local Plan. This plan sets out the visions and overall development strategy for the borough (outside of the North York Moors National Park) and how it will be achieved over the plan period until 2032. It forms part of the statutory development plan for the borough and is used to direct decisions on planning applications and to provide a spatial planning framework for the many plans and strategies prepared by the Council.\r\nThe Local Plan replaces the Local Development Framework, including the adopted Core Strategy and Development Policies Development Plan Documents (DPDs) and the Saved Policies of the Redcar & Cleveland Local Plan (1999).\r\n\r\nAdopted Policies Map: Policies Maps provide a geographic illustration of the policies within the adopted development plan. The previous Proposals Map for the borough had been prepared to represent the policies of the Core Strategy and Development Policies DPDs and was adopted in September 2007.\r\nThe Proposals Map has now been replaced by the Local Plan Policies Map (May 2018) in order to reflect the adoption of the Redcar & Cleveland Local Plan (May 2018) and the Joint Tees Valley Minerals and Waste Development Plan Documents (Sep 2011).\r\nThe Policies Map illustrates the site specific policies, allocations and designations of the adopted development plan and relates to the area of the borough that lies outside of the North York Moors National Park. Further details about the Policies Map and the development plan can be found at www.redcar-cleveland.gov.uk\r\n\r\nDisclaimers\r\nThe information shown on the Local Plan Policies Map is accurate to the best of the knowledge of Redcar & Cleveland Borough Council at the time of publication.\r\nSome parts of the borough fall within consultation zones for the Health and Safety Executive, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Environment Agency. Please note that these zones are not shown on the Policies Map. For further details regarding these zones, please contact Development Services or the relevant agency directly.\r\n",
