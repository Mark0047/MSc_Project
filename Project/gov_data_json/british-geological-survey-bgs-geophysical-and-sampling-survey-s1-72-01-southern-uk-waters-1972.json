        "notes": "This sampling and geophysical survey has been carried out by British Geological Survey (BGS) formerly Institute of Geological Sciences (IGS) for BGS, the survey took place from to July to December 1972 in Cardigan Bay (28 July to 11 August and 5-8 October), Bristol Channel (12 August to 15 October ), North Irish Sea (16 October to 4 December) and The Wash (December) on board the MV Whitethorn. The purpose was to collect data for IGS Continental Shelf Unit 1 as part of the ongoing UK regional mapping plus other projects. Although this was primarily a drilling and sampling survey geophysical equipment was operated but not routinely. Sea floor data were collected using echo sounder and transit sonar. Sub-bottom profiling data were collected using pinger. Sample data were collected using borehole wireline drilling, gravity corer (rock and sediment) and shipek grab. These data are archived by BGS. No BGS survey report currently available, summary descriptions of surveys are contained in IGS 1972 annual report.",
