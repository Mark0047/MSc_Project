TFS or International Waste Shipments are terms used for exporting and importing waste. The Transfrontier Shipment of Waste regulations govern the movement of recyclable materials across borders either by road, rail, ait or sea. The European Community first introduced a directive on control procedures for the shipment of hazardous waste in 1984, when it became apparent that hazardous waste from developed countries was being exported and dumped in developing countries. RDF is produced from domestic and business waste, which includes biodegradable material as well as plastics.\n    ",
