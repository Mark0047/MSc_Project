        "notes": "The data held in this archive were collected from Cefas (or its predecessor \nthe Directorate of Fisheries Research) research cruises. They broadly cover \nthe European Shelf with some data from the Iberian Abyssal Plain. Data were \ncollected using the lowered CTD rosette system which is used when the vessel \nis stationary. Usually bottles were fired at particular depths and samples \ntaken for calibration. In early years only a limited set of parameters were \ncollected. Notably Pressure (Depth), Temperature and Conductivity (CTD). From \nConductivity Salinity can be calculated using the UNESCO 1978,1983 \nformulations . In subsequent years more sensors have been added, notably \nfluorometers, Optical back scatter or transmissometers and Light (PAR, photo \nsynthetically available radiation). The exact configuration varies between \ncruises and this is reflected in the data format of the output files.\n\nData was collected from research vessels on station, a profile from the \nsurface to near the sea bed is undertaken. The down cast data should be a \nclean profile. Water bottles for sample collection and calibration are fired \non the up cast.",
