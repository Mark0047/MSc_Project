A secondary objective as to assess the feasibility of operating sampling and geophysics on one ship. Seabed samples were collected with Shipek Grab, gravity corer, vibrocorer and rockdrill. Sea floor data were collected using echosounder and transit sonar. Subsurface seismic data were gathered using Sparker. Technical detail contained in BGS Marine Geophysics report 27.",
