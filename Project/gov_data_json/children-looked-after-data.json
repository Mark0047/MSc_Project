        "notes": "Data on children looked after by local authorities in England is collected via annual returns known as the SSDA903 return from English local authorities.  Data are collected at individual child level on those who are in care at 31 March each year, those who start or cease to be looked after including those adopted from care during the year ending 31 March, and for those who have recently left care, information as to their activity and accommodation on their 19th birthday is also collected.  Characteristics of these children are collected including date of birth, gender, ethnicity, category of need, type of placement and legal status.\r\nThe child level records are linked together across years to form a longitudinal database and each year, local authorities are able to amend data they have returned for previous years to reflect any changes or new information.\r\nThe SSDA903 data collection has existed in its current form since 2004. Prior to this it was made up of a series of separate returns, and from 1998-2003 there was a one-third sample collection as well as an aggregate return.\r\n",

Some of the more commonly used raw data on children looked after is held in the Department's national pupil database.\r\nThe Secretary of State can share raw data from the national pupil database under strict terms and conditions with named bodies and third parties who for the purpose of promoting the education or wellbeing of children in England are conducting research or analysis, producing statistics, or providing information, advice or guidance. This has provided invaluable evidence on education to inform independent research, as well as studies commissioned by the Department.\r\nAccess is subject to requesters complying with terms and conditions imposed under contractual arrangements and a rigorous accreditation process."
