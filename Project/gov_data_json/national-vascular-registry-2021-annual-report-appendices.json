        "notes": "The NVR is the National Vascular Registry. It is a national clinical audit commissioned by the Health Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP) to measure the quality of care for patients who undergo vascular surgery in NHS hospitals, and was formed in January 2013.\r\n\r\nThe NVR is part of the National Clinical Audit and Patient Outcomes Programme (NCAPOP). There are a number of national clinical audits within NCAPOP. Each one collects data on the care received by different groups of patients and provides local NHS trusts with reports on their practice and performance.\r\n\r\nThese datasets contain the results published within the 2021 Annual Report relating to all NVR procedures, for UK NHS trusts. The data relates to patients undergoing procedures up until the end of 2020.",
