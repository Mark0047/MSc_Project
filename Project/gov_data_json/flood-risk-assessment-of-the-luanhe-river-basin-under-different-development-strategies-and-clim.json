        "notes": "The dataset describes the data needed for and results produced by the flood risk assessment framework under different development strategies of Luanhe river basin under a changing climate. The Luanhe river basin is located in the northeast of the North China Plain (115\u00b030' E-119\u00b045' E, 39\u00b010' N-42\u00b040'N) of China, is an essential socio-economic zone on its own in North-Eastern China, and also directly contributes to and influences the socio-economic development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The dataset here used for investigating the flood risk includes: (1) uplifts of future climate scenarios to 2030 (2) the validation results of a historical event that happened in 2012 (3) the flood inundation prediction under different development strategies and climate scenarios to 2030 (4) and the spatial resident density map in Luanhe river basin to 2030. Wherein, the uplifts of the future climate change is generated based on the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) dataset and will be applied to the future design rainfall to represent the future climate scenarios; a 2012 event is select to validate the flood model, and the remote sensing data is adopted as real-world observation data; considering the uplifts and future land use data as input, the validated flood model is applied to produce flood inundation prediction under different development strategies and climate scenarios to 2030; and the inundation results are used to overlay the Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4) and then calculate the flood risk map of the local resident. These data are mainly open data or produced by authors. With all these data, the flood risk of the Luanhe river basin in the near future (2030) can be assessed.
