        "notes": "The map shows the location and names of boreholes with digital geophysical logs acquired by the former National Coal Board and British Coal during their exploration for coal in the UK. Ownership of UK coal exploration data was transferred to the Coal Authority (Coal Authority) following privatisation of the UK coal industry. The Coal Authority have appointed the British Geological Survey as custodian of this important national geological data archive. These data are in general publicly available; however, access to data within active mining licences is restricted in that it requires the consent of the mining licensee. The Coal Authority data archive includes digital data for some of the geophysical borehole logging. These are mainly in the form of original field tapes; however, also available are some data transcribed onto more modern media during BGS projects. The BGS will be pleased to provide information on data availability for named boreholes or within specified geographic areas, together with cost estimates and options for supplying copies.",
