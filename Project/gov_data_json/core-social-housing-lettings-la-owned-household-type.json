        "notes": "This dataset comprises new general needs lettings, let at social rent levels owned by Local Authorities, classified by household type\n\nThese data are for new social housing lettings at the local authority area level, and are derived from record level data recorded through the COntinous REcording of social housing lettings. They cover new General Needs lettings, at social rent levels, owned by Local Authorities (LAs). All figures are unweighted and are therefore not fully consistent with the weighted social rent data at national level in the 'Social Housing Lettings in England' statistical release.\r\n\r\nSome Local Authority areas are missing from the Local Authority owned datasets due to there being either no LA owned lettings in that area, or there being too few lettings in an area for the data to be released, as it is deemed disclosive.\r\n\r\nData are given for the household type of each general needs social rent LA letting. Household type is derived from the demographic information for the household, as reported by the tenant. Where any of the household members' age or relationship to the tenant has been refused, the household type is classified as 'other'.",
