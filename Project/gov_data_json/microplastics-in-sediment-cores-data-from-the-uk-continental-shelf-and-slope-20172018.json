One CSV file reports locations and \ntechnical details for the cores, along with their slices, subsamples and the \nnumber of microplastic particles and fibres recorded in each 5g sample \nprocessed. Details of how the cores were sampled and processed can be found in \nthe publication and its supporting information.\n\nThe second CSV file contains x-y data for the micro-ATR-IR analysis of \nrepresentative particles picked from some of the filters, to provide some \nnumerical data on polymer types and fractions of Nile Red positive particles \nthat could be positively identified as plastics (positives), those that were \nbiological in origin (false positives) and those that could not be confidently \nidentified. Details of the procedure for this appear below. Images of the \nparticles along with their IR spectra can be found in the ESI accompanying the \npublication.",
