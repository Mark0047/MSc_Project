        "notes": "The spreadsheet gathers the data collected during a brine:CO2 flow-through experiment conducted on a weakly-cemented synthetic sandstone core sample using the multiflow experimental rig for CO2 experiments, designed and assembled at the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton. The test was configured to assess geophysical monitoring and deformation of reservoirs subjected to CO2 injection in shallow weakly-cemented (North Sea-like, e.g., Sleipner) CO2 storage sandstone reservoirs. The tests was conducted in the rock physics laboratory at the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, during 2015-2016, as part of the DiSECCS project with funding from the United Kingdom\u2019s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC grant EP/K035878/1) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). The experiment was a steady state brine-CO2 flow-through test in which realistic shallow CO2 geosequestration conditions were simulated, to related geophysical signatures to the hydrodynamic and geomechanical behaviour of the rock sample. The confining and pore pressure conditions were similar to those estimated for shallow North Sea Sleipner-like, storage reservoirs, but simulating inflation/depletion cyclic scenarios for increasing brine:CO2 fractional flow rates. The data include ultrasonic P- and S-wave velocities and their respective attenuation factors, axial, radial and volumetric strains, and electrical resistivity; also relative permeability to both fluids (CO2 and brine) is displayed as a function of pore volume times, associated to increasing CO2 to brine contents in the sample.",
