Plankton samples were \ncollected at each site on a planned survey grid. In addition to Nephrops \nlarvae, fish eggs and larvae were also analysed. The data described here \nconsists of the numbers of Nephrops larvae and fish eggs and larvae identified \nfrom the main net samples collected on a survey carried out in May-June 1982, \nalong with associated positional and ancillary data and volumes filtered.",
