        "notes": "Spatial predictions of the fractions of mud, sand and gravel as continuous \nresponse variables for the north-west European continental shelf. Mud, sand \nand gravel fractions range from 0-1 (i.e. 0-100%). These fractions were \ngenerated from two additive log-ratios (ALR), ALRs and ALRm which are \nindependent, unconstrained response variables. These raw predictions as \nrasters are also included presented in the attached dataset. Predicted \nfractions have been combined to predict the likely sediment classification \nbased on the EUNIS level 3 sediment classification for broadscale habitats, \nFolk 5, Folk 7, Folk 11 and Folk 15 classification schemes. These are \navailable as raster tif files with an ArcGIS layer file indicating the \nappropriate class for each raster value.\n\nFor all predictions an accompanying map of the spatial distribution of \nerror/accuracy is also included as a separate raster. For the three components \nof the sediment fraction a smoothed Root-Mean-Squared-Error layer is \navailable. For the classification maps a smoothed local accuracy map is \navailable.",
