Fisheries Sensitivity Maps in British Waters' which includes \nmaps of the main spawning and nursery grounds for 14 commercially important \nspecies (cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, Norway pout, blue whiting, mackerel, \nherring, sprat, sandeels, plaice, lemon sole, sole and Norway lobster).\n\nDuring the late 1990s, a collaborative project between the national fisheries \nlaboratories (Cefas and the then Fisheries Research Services, Aberdeen), the \nUK Offshore Operator's Association (UKOOA), the Scottish Fishermen's \nAssociation (SFF) and the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations \n(NFFO) produced the Fisheries Sensitivity Maps in British Waters.\n\nThe data describe the sensitivities of the main commercial species under five \nheadings: Individual species spawning areas; Individual species nursery areas; \nMonthly seismic restriction areas; Fishing effort maps; Relative value maps.",
