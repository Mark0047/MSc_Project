(IGS Report No 83) Navigation: Magnavox integrated satellite navigation/doppler sonar system, back-up control was from the Decca Navigator Mk 12. Equipment: Atlas Deso 10 and Edig 10 echo sounder, Askania GSS-3 gravity meter, Edo Pinger, EG&G 9 candle spark array, Klein Dual Scan Sonar System and BP Sonar System. No information on magnetometer. The first objective was to survey seven proposed borehole sites with sparker and pinger. These sites were to the north-west of Scilly. During leg 2 it became necessary to survey additional sites to the south-west of the Lizard. The second objective was a regional marine geophysical survey of the 1:250000 Scilly sheet, which would include the use of gravity meter, magnetometer, sparker, pinger and sonar.",
