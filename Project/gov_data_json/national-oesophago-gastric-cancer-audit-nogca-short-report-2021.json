The audit aims to support NHS services to improve the quality of care delivered to these patients.\r\n\r\nThe National Oesophago-Gastric Cancer Audit is a collaborative, national clinical audit run by the Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons of Great Britain & Ireland (AUGIS), British Society of Gastroenterologists (BSG), Royal College of Radiologists, NHS Digital, and the Clinical Effectiveness Unit at the Royal College of Surgeons of England. The audit is part of the National Clinical Audit and Patient Outcomes Programme (NCAPOP), that is managed by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership.\r\n\r\nThe 2021 Short Report describes the use of evidence-based radiotherapy regimens among oesophago-gastric cancer patients with a palliative treatment plan.\r\n\r\nThe report does not contain individual patient information, nor does it contain any patient identifiable data.\r\n",
