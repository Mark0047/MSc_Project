        "notes": "These files contain data for microscopy and mineral analyses on Fe-Ni-Cu sulfide minerals in the lower crust below arc systems using the example of the Ivrea Zone in Italy. Samples are lower crustal cumulates with variable concentrations of Fe-Ni-Cu sulfides collected by Dave Holwell from the Ivrea Zone. The sample details will be logged in a separate data entry and more information can be found in the open access paper by Holwell et al (2022) in Nature Geoscience, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28275-y. Data were acquired during 2019, 2020 and 2021. Folders include: metadata (time-resolved analysis spectral data) for laser ablation ICP-MS analysis of sulfide minerals. Laser-ablation ICPMS analyses were performed using a ESI UP213 laser system coupled to a Thermo iCAPRQ ICP-MS system at the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Cardiff University. The data were gathered to understand the concentrations of precious and semi-metal trace elements and their likely mineral forms in the various Fe-Ni-Cu sulfide minerals. Collected under the From Arc Magma to Ore System (FAMOS) Project.",
