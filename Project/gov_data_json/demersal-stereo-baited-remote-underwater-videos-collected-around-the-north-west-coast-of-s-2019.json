        "notes": "As part of the Commonwealth Marine Economies Programme (CMEP) Cefas conducted \na demersal stereo-Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV) survey of the western \nside of the island from Soufriere Bay to the northern tip of St. Lucia. A \ntotal of 87 1-hour long samples were successfully acquired to a maximum depth \nof ~50 m during a two week survey in February 2019. Four camera frames were \nused, each fitted with two Sony FDR-X3000 ActionCam cameras with a 7-degree \ninward facing angle directed at the wire mesh bait bag. Stereo-BRUVs field of \nviews were calibrated using the SeaGIS calibration cube and the CAL software. \nCalibration videos were acquired at the start and end of the survey. At each \nstation light and temperature were also recorded using a HOBO logger and these \nraw files are also provided in the raw format and as .csv file. \n\nFor further details about the collection and analysis methods of these raw \nvideos see the publication: https://doi.org/10.1002/aqc.3518\n\n All analysed stereo-BRUV data are available here: \n`https://doi.org/10.14466/CefasDataHub.115`_\n\nVideos were classified using \n\n\n\n\n.. _`https://doi.org/10.14466/cefasdatahub.115`:\n    https://doi.org/10.14466/CefasDataHub.115",
