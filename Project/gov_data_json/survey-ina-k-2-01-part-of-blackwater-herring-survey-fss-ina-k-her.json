        "notes": "This survey was undertaken by Cefas as part of the Blackwater Herring Survey \n(FSS: INA K HER);\n\nA series of cruises carried out from 1989 to 2009 each November on the INA-K \nin the Thames Estuary. The aims of which were to assess the state of herring\n(*Clupea harengus*) stocks through measurements of length samples and by \nageing a stratified selection of fish. The latter was also to determine the \nstock split between North Sea and Thames fish as there is a great deal of \nmixing of stocks in the area. Stock identification was done by a combination \nof first year growth observed in the otolith and the maturity stage of the \nfish.\n\nSurvey took place between 17/11/2001 and 30/11/2001 on INA K\n\nEquipment used during this survey :\n\n\n-   Larson Sprat Trawl\n\nSurvey operations were undertaken on 36 stations\n\n8 different species were caught on this survey",
