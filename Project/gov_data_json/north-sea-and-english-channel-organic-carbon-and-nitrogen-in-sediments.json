Mostly UK waters in coverage but some data from the Oyster Grounds \n(Dutch waters). Cores were sliced and sampled at a range of depth horizons and \nthe data compiled to provide average values for the 0-5 cm and 5-10cm depth \nlayers. These were used to summarise profiles and describe spatial variance \nwithin four Ecohydrodynamic Units (EHUs).",
