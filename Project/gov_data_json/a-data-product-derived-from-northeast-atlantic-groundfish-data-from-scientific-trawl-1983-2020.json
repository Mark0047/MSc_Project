        "notes": "This is a data product to support state indicators that are based from \ngroundfish biological data, derived using primary data from surveys undertaken \nin the Northeast Atlantic between 1983 and 2020. Catch records by taxonomic \ngroup and by length category in terms of biomass and numbers of fish \nstandardised to duration (per hour) or to the area swept by the haul. Data are \navailable from multiple surveys using data downloaded from the ICES database \nof trawl surveys (DATRAS) once quality-controlled and standardised following \nprocedures detailed in Greenstreet and Moriarty 2017. Data file names reflect \nthe OSPAR region sampled, country conducting the sampling, fishing gear and \ntime of years of sampling (as defined by Greenstreet and Moriarty 2017), e.g.: \nBBICFraBT4 refers to Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast data from France by a \nBeam Trawl survey in quarter 4 of the year and GNSIntOT3 refers to Greater \nNorth Sea data from International (multiple countries) sampling by an Otter \nTrawl survey in quarter 3 of the year etc.\n\nGreenstreet, S.P.R. and Moriarty, M.
