The information is used to monitor and develop policies for the supply of aggregates. This data set depicts the flow of crushed rock aggregate between the regions of England and Wales. The data originator also has similar data for sand and gravel and also the same data derived from the 1997 and 2001 Aggregate Minerals Surveys.",
