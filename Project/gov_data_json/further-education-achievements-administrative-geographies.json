From 2013/14 this is derived from the Consolidated Data Return (CDR), a computerised return consisting of an individual record for each final year enrolment and its associated outcome on regulated courses in Northern Ireland Further Education Institutions. Prior to 2013/14 this information was derived from the Further Education Leavers Survey, a computerised return consisting of an individual record for each final year enrolment and its associated outcome on assessed professional and technical courses in Northern Ireland Further Education Institutions. The dataset is gathered annually at the 1st November and is a full year count of the previous academic year. The academic year covers the period 1 August 2014 - 31 July 2015. Colleges collect the information on Enrolment forms and add outcome information. This information is entered onto the Colleges Management Information System. The Department extracts and validates this information from the colleges. The data is then merged with the CPD and checked. It is then forwarded to NINIS.",

Digital NI aims to help establish a culture within Northern Ireland that develops and enhances Digital capability not just through interactions with Government, but also with local companies and throughout communities. Within government the Digital Transformation Service is facilitating this cultural shift through a number of methods, transforming Government services, making data open and available and encouraging and coaching those who lack digital skills.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that opening up our data is the right thing to do in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the Public Sector in Northern Ireland. It has the potential to encourage new commercial opportunities and drive economic growth and innovation across public and private sectors.",
