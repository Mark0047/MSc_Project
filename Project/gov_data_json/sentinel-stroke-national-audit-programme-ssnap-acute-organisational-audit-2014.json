        "notes": "The SSNAP acute organisational audit is a snapshot audit which runs on a biennial basis and reports on the structure and organisation of acute stroke services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The results of the 2014 acute organisational audit contain national and hospital level findings on the organisation of stroke services, in particular acute care organisation, staffing levels and skill mix, provision of stroke treatments, TIA (mini stroke) services, engagement with patients and carers, and pathway at discharge. The results reflect the organisation of stroke services as of 1 July 2014. 100% of eligible hospitals in England, Wales and Northern Ireland participated in the audit.\r\n\r\nThe full results portfolio of named hospital results, available to download below, describes the performance for all 183 participating sites in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. All participating sites were measured against 40 key indicators, grouped into 6 audit domains, covering key aspects of acute stroke service organisation. Similarly to the SSNAP clinical audit an overall score was derived from the 40 key indicators and 6 domains giving hospitals a performance comparator which they could use against other hospitals and/or the national results.\r\n\r\nFull Results Portfolio: A very detailed file showing individual hospital results for all domains and key indicators as well as every data item benchmarked against the national average. \r\n\r\nSummary spreadsheet: Presents individual hospital results for all domains and key indicators of acute stroke service organisation.\r\n\r\nPerformance tables: Shows hospital level performance (band A-E) for 6 domains of stroke service organisation and overall.\r\n\r\nGeneric report: Shows all national results for the 2014 acute organisational audit, including domains, changes over time and country comparisons.\r\n\r\nPublic report: Presents national level results for key indicators of stroke service organisation. It also includes changes over time and country comparison.",
