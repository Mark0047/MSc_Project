        "notes": "These data contain concentrations in micrograms per litre (ug/L) of the \nindividual accessory pigments of phytoplankton measured by High Pressure \nLiquid Chromatography (HPLC). Pigment samples were taken primarily on Cefas \nfisheries and SmartBuoy cruises in the North Sea and Celtic Seas, and sent to \nDHI laboratory in Denmark for HPLC analysis. Data was then sent back to Cefas \nand matched with metadata and quality controlled. Chlorophyll concentrations \nfrom this dataset have a variety of uses: for assessment of concentrations for \npurposes such as eutrophication assessments, validation of remote sensing \nderived chlorophyll estimates, as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, or to \ncalibrate fluorometers. Pigment concentrations can be applied like a \nfingerprint to derive phytoplankton functional types and give information \nabout the phytoplankton community.",
