It is refreshed nightly.\r\n\r\nThe fields should be relatively self-explanatory when comparing the data with the website. But these are the conversions provided:\r\n\r\n* Dates were originally in unix format (e.g. 'created_unix') and so the iso-version is provided too (e.g. 'created') .\r\n* 'uri' is an internal equivalent for a URL, and the external url is stored in 'uri_expanded'\r\n* tags have been converted from internal ids ('field_tags') to names ('tags')\r\n* related dataset ids have been converted from internal drupal IDs ('field_uses_dataset') to ckan IDs ('field_uses_dataset_ckan_ids'), which can in turn be converted to ckan names & URLs using the metadata dump.\r\n\r\nThe file is JSON lines format http://jsonlines.org/ , so you don't need to load the whole thing into memory to parse the json - just do a line at a time. It is also zipped with gzip.",
