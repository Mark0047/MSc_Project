        "notes": "[THIS DATASET HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN]. The Land Cover Map of Great Britain 1990 (1km percentage target class, GB), is a raster digital dataset, providing a classification of land cover types into 25 classes, at a 1km resolution. The dataset consists of a set of 1km bands, each containing one of 25 target classes (or 'sub' classes). Each band of the dataset contains the percentage of the specified habitat class per 1km, derived from a higher resolution (25m) dataset. The map was produced using supervised maximum likelihood classifications of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper satellite data. The 25 mapped classes include sea and inland waters, bare, suburban and urban areas, arable farmland, pastures and meadows, rough grass, grass heaths and moors, bracken, dwarf shrub heaths and moorland, scrub, deciduous and evergreen woodland, and upland and lowland bogs. It can potentially be used to plan, manage or monitor agriculture, ecology, conservation, forestry, environmental assessment, water supplies, urban spread, transport, telecommunications, recreation and mineral extraction. The map was produced in the early 1990s by a forerunner of the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, at Monks Wood. Note: The bands in the dataset run from 1-26, not 0-25 as stated in the documentation. Hence '1' is unclassifed (not '0'), '2' is sea/estuary and so on. Full details about this dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5285/0172cc8c-8b5c-46cf-b08a-785ab832e88c",
