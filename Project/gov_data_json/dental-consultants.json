        "notes": "Dental Consultants in England \r\n\r\nContains: \r\n\r\nName and identifying codes for Dental Consultants employed by NHS Trusts in England. The codes are derived from the Practitioner\u2019s General Dental Council code (GDC code), to which a \u2018CD\u2019 prefix is added. GDC numbers can vary in length from 3 to 6 characters, so in order to maintain a standard \r\n\r\nlength of 8 characters (the same as medical consultant codes) filling zeros are used between the prefix and the GDC number, where required. \r\n\r\nMany consultants working in a dental specialty are also qualified doctors, and therefore have a GMC number in addition to their GDC number. In these cases, the consultants are allocated a Consultant Code (derived from their GMC number) and are therefore included in the consultant file econcur.csv \r\n\r\nor wconcur.csv (see above). Sometimes this is in addition to an entry in edconcur.csv; sometimes the practitioners will only have a record in econcur.csv or wconcur.csv. \r\n\r\nThere are some dental consultants however, who do not have a GMC number. They are qualified purely in their dental specialty and only have a GDC number. These consultants are included in edconcur.csv only.",
