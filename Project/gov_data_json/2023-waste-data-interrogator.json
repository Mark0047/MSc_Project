This data is used to monitor compliance but has historically been used by DEFRA and local authorities to assist in planning for new waste facilities and for monitoring against statutory targets. We have provided this data in an interrogatable format since 2006. The dataset is calendar year and holds the data from around 6,000 regulated sites. Operator waste returns are public register information unless a claim for commercial confidentiality has been accepted. In these cases the data is provided but the site details are not. This is so that the data can be included in aggregated figures but cannot be attributed to a particular site. Data supplied does not include details of waste producers \n\nINFORMATION WARNING Details of operators who have claimed commercial confidentiality are not provided  Attribution statement: \u00a9 Environment Agency copyright and/or database right 2024.
