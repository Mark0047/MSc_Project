Digital NI aims to help establish a culture within Northern Ireland that develops and enhances Digital capability not just through interactions with Government, but also with local companies and throughout communities. Within government the Digital Transformation Service is facilitating this cultural shift through a number of methods, transforming Government services, making data open and available and encouraging and coaching those who lack digital skills.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that opening up our data is the right thing to do in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the Public Sector in Northern Ireland. It has the potential to encourage new commercial opportunities and drive economic growth and innovation across public and private sectors.",

Research projects focused on identifying woodlands across Northern Ireland with more targeted surveys undertaken in AONBs, County Fermanagh and Lagan Valley Regional Park where the incidence of woodlands is high.

Where point data only is available for older woodland surveys, further mapping is required to provide a fuller representation of all priority woodlands across Northern Ireland. The Ancient Woodland Inventory has identified small blocks of woodland which may be considered as long-established or ancient woodland, but the priority woodland communities frequently extend beyond those areas mapped as ancient woodland and these must also be included as priority woodland when considering planning applications. A comprehensive survey of semi-natural woodlands in County Fermanagh provides a fairly comprehensive list of priority woodlands in this county.",
