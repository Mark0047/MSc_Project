        "notes": "SCCS is the largest Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) research group in the UK. Our internationally renowned researchers provide connected strength across the full CCS chain. With our unique position SCCS is able to act as the conduit between academia, industry and government. We are able to provide a single point of coordination for all aspects of CCS research ranging from capture engineering and geoscience, to social perceptions and environmental impact, through to law and petroleum economics. SCCS has access to cutting-edge experimental and analytical facilities, expertise in field studies, modelling and simulation, key academic and research personnel to accelerate the development of CO2 transportation, capture and subsurface storage. We undertake strategic fundamental research and are also available for consultancy. In addition, we perform a key role in providing impartial advice to industry, the public sector, government agencies, and policy makers. Founded in 2005, SCCS is a partnership of the British Geological Survey, Heriot-Watt University, the University of Aberdeen, the University of Edinburgh and the University of Strathclyde working together with universities across Scotland. SCCS is funded by the Scottish Funding Council (SFC).",
