        "notes": "The Dundee Local Development Plan 2019 sets out the land use strategy that will guide development across Dundee up to 2029 and beyond.\nSince the previous local development plan Dundee has consolidated its position as an exemplar of design with the prestigious accolade of being designated as the UK\u2019s only UNESCO City of Design.\n\u201cThe City was given the accolade in 2014, based on our incredible design heritage \u2013 from jute to newspapers \u2013 and our design future including the V&A, our rediscovered buildings such as West Ward Works and the range of talented designers working across disciplines from digital to jewellery.\u201d Dundee Partnership 2015\nLooking ahead the City will continue to promote and demonstrate a high quality of design in all new development, creating not only an attractive built environment but enhancing the natural space within the City. Using the Place Standard Tool the Council has been nationally recognised for its innovative approach to working with communities to consider the place that they live. The overall aim is to create good quality places for people to live, work and play within the City.\nAn innovative Council-led approach to delivering upfront infrastructure has enabled housing delivery across the City in areas including the Western Gateway and Whitfield, as well as creating a platform for the delivery of National development within Dundee Waterfront.\nAt the forefront of the changing physical and cultural environment within the City is Dundee\u2019s award winning Waterfront regeneration project. An early success of this project is the opening of the V&A Dundee, an international centre of design for Scotland - the first ever design museum to be built in the UK outside London. Related projects such as the new railway station and Slessor Gardens will not only benefit local residents but will provide an attractive welcome to the City. This is a unique opportunity to kick-start unprecedented growth in the City\u2019s leisure and culture offering; an offer that has already been recognised nationwide with GQ magazine naming Dundee as \u201cBritain\u2019s coolest little City\u201d in 2015.\n\nDundee\u2019s foundation as a centre of excellence in research and technology continues to provide an opportunity to further modernise the City and embrace new technologies. The emerging Tay Cities Deal has identified the opportunity to reduce fuel poverty and carbon emissions within Dundee through proposals including district heat networks and a hydrogen energy park - which will be the first of its kind in the UK. Through the Tay Cities Deal the City will receive significant financial investment to deliver sustainable economic growth and the promotion of new job opportunities.\nDundee\u2019s outstanding location is supported by a varied and high quality natural and built environment. The City\u2019s valued natural heritage sites range from internationally important habitats through to public open spaces and individual gardens. This quality natural and built environment is important for the quality of life, health and wellbeing of residents within the City. A positive approach to responding to the effects of climate change will ensure that the quality of the environment is maintained and improved for the benefit of future generations. Within this context the Local Development Plan sets out how it will play its part in the delivery of the future vision for the City.",
