        "notes": "The introduction of The Town and Country Planning (Brownfield Land Register) Regulations 2017 requires us to publish and maintain a register of brownfield land. This land must exceed 0.25ha (or be capable of supporting five dwellings) and be suitable, available and achievable for residential-led development (that is, self-contained dwellings).\r\n\r\nThe register will be structured in two parts. Part one will comprise sites which, based on best available information, are considered:\r\n\r\nsuitable\r\navailable\r\nachievable\r\nAnd in accordance with the guidance have regard to:\r\n\r\nthe development plan\r\nnational polices and advice\r\nany guidance issues by the Secretary of State\r\nPart two will be a subset of part one. It will be made up of the sites which we decide to grant permission in principle. Permission in principle is a new route to consent, which together with technical details consent will form an implementable planning permission.\r\n\r\nThe first brownfield register must be in place by the end of 2017. Due to this timescale, we've focussed on producing part one of the register by this date. It doesn't include any sites on part two at this stage. For sites without planning permission listed on part one, residential potential and dwelling capacity should be treated as a guide only and subject to constraints.\r\n\r\nPart one of the register will comprise sites which are brownfield and that are part of the current Local Plan, have planning permission or have been submitted to us for consideration as part of the Local Plan review \u2018Call for Sites and Policy Suggestions\u2019 consultation.\r\n\r\nWe're required to maintain the register. So there will be opportunities for further sites to be proposed for consideration.",
