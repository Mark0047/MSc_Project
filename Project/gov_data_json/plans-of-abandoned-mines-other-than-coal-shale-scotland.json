        "notes": "The collection comprises plans of mine workings for ironstone, fireclay, limestone, baryte and metalliferous minerals for Scotland dating from 1872 onwards deposited on abandonment of a mine in compliance with the coal and metalliferous mines regulation acts. The plans are held on behalf of the Health & Safety Executive (HSE) and total about 610 plans. Indexed in the BGS Plans Database Index. As the collection relates to plans of mines abandoned after the 1872 Act, the holdings are fairly complete after this date. The Metalliferous Mines Act originally applied only to mines employing more than 12 men, (eg. some limestone mines). Where non-coal minerals were worked with coal, the abandonment plans are retained by the Coal Authority. Coal Authority also holds exclusively non-coal mine plans not covered by Mine Abandonment Plan collection. All non-confidential data held by NGRC Edinburgh (National Geological Records Centre). Mainly coalfield areas of Central Scotland with large collection relating to the Leadhills-Wanlockhead mining district.",
