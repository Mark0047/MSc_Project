        "notes": "Our study was driven by concerns that afforesting the headwaters of the Upper Halladale River in North Scotland would affect water quality and the local salmon fishery. The main issue was the threat of increased surface water acidification due to pollutant scavenging by the growing conifer forest but there were also worries about the impact of the soil disturbance and hydrological changes accompanying ploughing and drainage operations and nutrient losses following planned fertiliser applications. The headwaters support important spawning and nursery areas for salmon and were therefore considered to be especially vulnerable to afforestation.\nFollowing an initial one-year study to evaluate the potential impacts, the scheme was agreed and planting proceeded in 1996. This presented an ideal opportunity to continue the monitoring to look at the short, medium and long-term effects of afforestation and forest growth on the chemistry and biology of a sensitive freshwater system. Water samples are regularly taken from six sites and analysed for a wide range of water quality parameters. The results of our study will also assess the efficacy of forest management practices in protecting the freshwater environment.\nSee papers below for more details:\nForestry Commission (1994).
