Data were collected from both the Exe \nestuary and the Lynher estuary between August 1995 and May 1997. The csv \nfile entitled \"nematodes_field_exe_lynher_1995_1997\" contains data from \nfield collected sediments. The csv files entitled \n\"nematodes_mud_lab_1995_1997\" and \"nematodes_sand_lab_1995_1997\" contains data \nfrom laboratory experimental treatments sumulating different types of \ndisturbance, including physical disturbance, biological disturbance and \norganic enrichment. The Read Me describes the conditions of each microcosm \nfrom these experiments.",
