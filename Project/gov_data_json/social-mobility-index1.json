It examines a range of measures of the educational outcomes achieved by young people from disadvantaged backgrounds and the local job and housing markets to shed light on which are the best and worst places in England in terms of the opportunities young people from poorer backgrounds have to succeed.</p>\n<p>Please take a look at our interactive atlas spine chart, where you can discover how all the English districts, unitaries and boroughs ranked, as well as the data scores  behind the ranks. <a href=\"http://atlas.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/SocialMobilityIndex/atlas.html\">http://atlas.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/SocialMobilityIndex/atlas.html</a></p>\n",
