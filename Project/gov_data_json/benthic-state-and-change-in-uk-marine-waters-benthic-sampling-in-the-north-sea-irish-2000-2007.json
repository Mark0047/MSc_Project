This dataset contains \ndetails of the abundance of macrofauna found at each of the 155 sample \nstations collected between 2000 and 2007. \n\nEnvironmental variables quantified for each station included bathymetry \n(except North Sea and western Scotland), stratification, bottom temperature \nand a number of derived granulometric parameters (e.g., % silt, % gravel, \nsorting coefficient, skewness, kurtosis), together with modelled parameters \nsuch as bed tidal stress, wave stress, bottom temperature, a stratification \nindex and satellite-derived surface chlorophyll a (mean values for 2002-07 \nused). \n\nEstimates of the benthic productivity associated with such communities were \nalso derived, for the first time, at this large spatial scale.",
