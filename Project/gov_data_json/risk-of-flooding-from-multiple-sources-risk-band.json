        "notes": "This dataset is not suitable for identifying whether an individual property will flood. \nGIS layer showing risk of flooding from multiple sources, grouped into 4 bands.\nOur Risk of Flooding from Multiple Sources (RoFMS) information is a national scale assessment. It gives an indication of what areas of land may be at risk of flooding from more than one source. This first version of the assessment considers flooding from rivers, the sea and surface water. Information used to create this dataset comes directly from our existing products: Risk of Flooding from Rivers and the Sea (RoFRS) and Risk of Flooding from Surface Water (RoFSW). \nThere are 3 spatial datasets available for RoFMS:\n1. RoFMS Risk Band \n(risk of flooding from multiple sources grouped into 4 bands)\n2. RoFMS Suitability \n(an indication of the scale it is appropriate to use the information, grouped into 5 bands)\n3. RoFMS Risk Contribution \n(the proportion of the combined risk resulting from the primary flood source input data)\nFor local surface water flood risk information, please contact the relevant Lead Local Flood Authority. \nThis dataset is one output of our Risk of Flooding from Multiple Sources (RoFMS) mapping. For other output datasets, please search data.gov.uk for RoFMS. Layers are available as *.lpk or *.tiff files and *.tfw files (with RGB values in the document). \nFor information on the creation, application and limitations of this data, please read the document linked below. Choose the bottom left 'Resource Locator\u2019 and click on 'Link' to access the document. \nInformation Warnings: Risk of Flooding from Multiple Sources is not to be used at property level. If the Content is displayed in map form to others we recommend it should not be used with basemapping more detailed than 1:10,000 as the data is open to misinterpretation if used as a more detailed scale. Because of the way they have been produced and the fact that they are indicative, the maps are not appropriate to act as the sole evidence for any specific planning or regulatory decision or assessment of risk in relation to flooding at any scale without further supporting studies or evidence.
