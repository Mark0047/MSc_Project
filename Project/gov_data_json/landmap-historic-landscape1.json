The LANDMAP database includes both objective and subjective information and is designed to enable landscape quality to be taken into account in decision making.  Geographic dataset showing historical landscape classification for Wales in the form of polygons (Aspect Areas) with large amounts of associated textual information, including General, Description, Evaluation, Recommendations, Area Boundary, Evaluation and Bibliography. This dataset focuses on archaeological and historical sites and how they relate to each other and to the surrounding landscape. The feature\r\ns mapped include those resulting from past human activity and structurally prominent patterns and features that contribute to the historic character of the present landscape. Information is gathered by LANDMAP in order to inform sustainable decision making and to enable landscape to be taken into account during decision making processes. Historic Landscape data can be used to assess the speed, direction and effect of change and to provide an understanding of how the landscape has evolved. A LANDMAP Quality Assurance Procedure is in place to ensure that LANDMAP Information meets an agreed standard of good practice and that data is accurate and consistent across Wales.\r\n\r\n    ",
