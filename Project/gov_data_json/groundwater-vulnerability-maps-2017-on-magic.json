        "notes": "This dataset is available for use for non-commercial purposes only on request as AfA248 dataset Groundwater Vulnerability Maps (2017). For commercial use please contact the British Geological Survey.\n\n The Groundwater Vulnerability Maps show the vulnerability of groundwater to a pollutant discharged at ground level based on the hydrological, geological, hydrogeological and soil properties within a single square kilometre.\nThe 2017 publication has updated the groundwater vulnerability maps to reflect improvements in data mapping, modelling capability and understanding of the factors affecting vulnerability\nTwo map products are available:\n\u2022 The combined groundwater vulnerability map. This product is designed for technical specialists due to the complex nature of the legend which displays groundwater vulnerability (High, Medium, Low), the type of aquifer (bedrock and/or superficial) and aquifer designation status (Principal, Secondary, Unproductive). These maps require that the user is able to understand the vulnerability assessment and interpret the individual components of the legend.\n\n\u2022 The simplified groundwater vulnerability map. This was developed for non-specialists who need to know the overall risk to groundwater but do not have extensive hydrogeological knowledge or the time to interpret the underlying data. The map has five risk categories (High, Medium-High, Medium, Medium-Low and Low) based on the likelihood of a pollutant reaching the groundwater (i.e. the vulnerability), the types of aquifer present and the potential impact (i.e. the aquifer designation status).\nThe two maps also identify areas where solution features that enable rapid movement of a pollutant may be present (identified as stippled areas) and areas where additional local information affecting vulnerability is held by the Environment Agency (identified as dashed areas).
