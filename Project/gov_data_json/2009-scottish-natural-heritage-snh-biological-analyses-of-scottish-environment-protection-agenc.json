        "notes": "Sub-littoral sediment sampling in Loch Sween. The sampling was undertaken by SEPA for their routine monitoring of Loch Sween (Argyll). \n     Loch Sween is a Scottish west coast fjordic sea loch located on the western side of the Kintyre peninsula and is a complex loch system with a number of unique geological and hydrographic features. The loch has been subject to a variety of monitoring and survey programmes and whilst a number of designated areas are present in or adjacent to the area (some with marine interests) the loch as a whole has no statutory nature conservation protection.\n     To help target nature conservation action SNH and JNCC have generated a focused list of habitats and species of importance in Scottish waters - the Priority Marine Features (PMFs). Provisions to designate new Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) within Scottish waters have recently been introduced through the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010 and the UK Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009. A subset of the PMFs (MPA search features) will drive the identification of Nature Conservation MPAs.\n     This study looked at existing survey data from within the Loch Sween area any data not currently held within Marine Recorder were entered into the database where appropriate.",
