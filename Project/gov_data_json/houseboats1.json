The government data is published in response to an external request for information seeking a record of the number of households who are boat dwellers in each local authority in England. They note that: \"Caseworkers use Dwelling Type \u201cTH\u201d and Dwelling Group \u201c72\u201d when they identify a houseboat, captured as part of the property attributes on the VOA administrative database. Total counts for each local authority district in England are provided. Counts are rounded to the nearest 10. However, counts of zero are reported as \u201c0\u201d and counts between one and four (inclusive) are reported as negligible and denoted by \u201c-\u201c. Totals may not sum due to rounding.\" As the figures are rounded to the nearest 10, we can see this only gives an indication of the number of houseboats in each local authority area; in addition, a local correspondent informs us that this is \"not an accurate way of calculating the numbers of houseboats since houseboats are not liable to pay council tax if the land they are moored on is not a hereditment\".</li>\n<li>A web search for local marinas and moorings in the local area, undertaken in April 2017.</li>\n</ol><p>We are very pleased to have now uploaded geo-coded data on the location of some of the marinas and moorings across the area in 2017, which has enabled us to produce a local map. We continue to seek new and improved sources of data, and updates to the goverment figures, as time progresses.</p>\n",
