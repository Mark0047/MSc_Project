        "notes": "This survey took place in September - November 2008 east of East Anglia. The survey was undertaken in joint collaboration between the British Geological Survey, the Centre for Ecology, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) and Wessex Archaeology. The aims of the R/V CEFAS Endeavour 18/08 / BGS 2008/04 cruise were to acquire high resolution multibeam echosounder, sidescan sonar, surface tow boomer and magnetometer data in the East Coast Regional Environmental Assessment area. This phase of data acquisition will be used to position vibrocore, clamshell grab, camera and biological sampling stations which will be visited during Spring 2009. The cruise was carried out under contract for the Aggregate Levy Sustainability Fund (MALSF). Technical details of the survey can be found in BGS Internal Report IR/08/074 and CEFAS Cruise Report CEND 18/08.",
