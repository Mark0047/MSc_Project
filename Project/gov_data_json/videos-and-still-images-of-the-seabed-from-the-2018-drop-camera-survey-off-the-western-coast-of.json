        "notes": "As part of the Commonwealth Marine Economies Programme (CMEP) Cefas collected \n212 drop camera video tows of the seabed off the western coast of St. Lucia in \nthe Caribbean. The purpose was to characterise the benthic fauna within the \narea and support the creation of benthic habitat maps for four key areas of \nthe island (Rodney Bay, Castries to Marigot Bay, Soufriere and Vieux Fort). \nThe videos and still images were acquired using a lightweight drop camera \nframe with a Bowtech high definition video camera, Olympus Mark III stills \ncamera, two lasers for scaling images and additional lighting for real colour \nimages of the seabed. The drop camera frame was lowered to the seabed by hand \nfrom a vessel, with the video monitored to maintain a consistent height above \nthe seabed. Tows were 15 minutes long with the vessel drifting in neutral so \nthe distance covered in each tow varied. Sample depths ranged from 4-80 m and \ncovered a range of habitats including bare sediment, seagrass, and coral and \nsponge dominated reefs. Still images were acquired every 10 seconds based on \nan automated timer. Only a limited number of the still images were processed \nfor the creation of the seabed maps, however, all images have been retained in \nthis data holding.",
