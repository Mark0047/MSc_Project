See: https://environment.data.gov.uk/dataset/8e5be50f-d465-11e4-ba9a-f0def148f590\n\nThe Flood Map for Planning (Rivers and Sea) shows the areas across England that could be affected by flooding from rivers or the sea. It also shows flood defences and the areas that benefit from them.\n\nThe Flood Map is designed to raise awareness among the public local authorities and other organisations of the likelihood of flooding and to encourage people living and working in areas prone to flooding to find out more and take appropriate action. \n\nThe Flood Map includes several layers of information, this dataset is: Spatial Flood Defences (without standardised attributes), which shows those defences constructed which have a standard of protection equal to or better than 1 in 100 (1%) for rivers and 1 in 200 (0.5%) from the sea.
