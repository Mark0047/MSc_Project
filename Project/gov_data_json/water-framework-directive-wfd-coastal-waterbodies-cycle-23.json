        "notes": "      Water Framework Directive (WFD) Coastal Waterbodies is a polygon Shapefile dataset containing attributes that have been collated as defined for the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). Article 2, clause 7 of the WFD defines coastal waterbodies as '...a surface water on the landward side of a line, every point of which is at a distance of one nautical mile on the seaward side from the nearest point of the baseline from which the breadth of territorial waters is measured, extending where appropriate up to the outer limit of transitional waters'. Coastal waters were defined by territorial waters 1 nautical mile from the Mean High Water coastline taken directly from OS 1:50K MeridianTM 2. The delineation between coastal and estuarine waters was delineated by t\r\nhe Environment Agency defined transitional waterbodies. Waterbodies are also split and assigned to River Basin Districts. Since waterbodies are attributed with a unique identifier 'EA_WB_ID' this dataset can be linked directly to other WFD data sources such as physical characteristics, risk, classification and proposed objectives. This dataset covers the layer for Cycle 2 of the Water framework Directive.\r\n\r\n    ",
