Article 2, clause 2 of the WFD defines them as '\u2026all water which is below the surface of the ground in the saturation zone and in direct contact with the ground or subsoil'. For the purposes of reporting under the WFD a groundwater body represent a distinct body of groundwater flow with a coherent flow unit including recharge and discharge areas with little flow across the boundaries. These reflect hydrogeological characteristics containing information on flow and stage properties, recharge and vulnerability to pollution. This has been undertaken through defining aquifers into differ\r\nent types and broken into catchment units at Catchment Abstraction Management Strategy (CAMS) scale.\r\n\r\n    ",
