        "notes": "This dataset is the output from the UK canopy cover webmap project, which aimed to assess the percentage tree canopy cover in every ward in the UK. Forest Research delivered the project with partners Brillianto, Trees for Cities, and Woodland Trust. Wards were classified as urban or rural based on size: wards larger than 1,000 Ha were classed as rural. Data were gathered through citizen science volunteers, who used the i-Tree Canopy tool (https://canopy.itreetools.org/) to assess percentage canopy cover within ward boundaries. A User Guide was provided to the volunteers, with step-by-step instructions and pictorial support (https://cdn.forestresearch.gov.uk/2018/11/canopy_cover_webmap_user_guide_-_updated_march_2021.pdf). i-Tree Canopy randomly distributes points within a study area (ward boundary), overlain on Google aerial imagery. Users examine the points in sequence to determine whether the point lies over a tree canopy or not, classifying each point as either \u201ctree\u201d or \u201cnon-tree\u201d accordingly. Typically 350 to 600 points were assessed per ward, leading to a standard error of less than 2%. Percentage tree canopy cover was calculated as (n/N)*100 where n is the number of \u201ctree\u201d points and N is the total number of sample points. Results were returned to Forest Research in the form of percentage canopy cover, standard error, number of points, and the i-Tree Canopy project file. Data quality was monitored through screening of submitted results by Forest Research project staff for all new participants, and at regular intervals for experienced contributors. Most wards were assessed only once. Where a ward was assessed by more than one contributor, the results were combined where possible. Data were collected between 2018 and 2022. All urban wards were completed.\n\ncountry [Country]\nThe country within which the Ward is located as defined by the Ward code. [E050000xx = England; N08000xxx = Northern Ireland; S1300xxxx = Scotland; W050000xx = Wales]\n\nwardcode [Ward code]\nThe unique code associated with the Ward boundary. Ward boundaries are based on OS Boundary-Line data (OS data \u00a9 Crown copyright and database right 2017). Most Ward boundaries are from the 2017 OS Boundary-Line dataset. However, a few users returned boundaries from the 2018 OS Boundary-Line dataset; the dataset was amended to reflect which boundary was used in the i-Tree Canopy assessment.\n\nwardname [Ward name]\nThe name of the Ward boundary. Ward boundaries are based on OS Boundary-Line data (OS data \u00a9 Crown copyright and database right 2017). Most Ward boundaries are from the 2017 OS Boundary-Line dataset. However, a few users returned boundaries from the 2018 OS Boundary-Line dataset; the dataset was amended to reflect which boundary was used in the i-Tree Canopy assessment.\n\ndesignated [Urban/Rural]\nWhether the Ward has been identified as an Urban or Rural Ward. Wards were classified as Urban or Rural based on size: wards larger than 1,000 Ha were classed as Rural. \n\nstatus [Status]\nCurrent analysis status of the ward. All Wards in the dataset have been Completed.\n\nsurvyear [Survey year]\nThe year the i-Tree Canopy assessment was completed, Data collected between 2018 and 2022.\n\npercancov [Percentage canopy cover]\nThe average canopy cover for the ward boundary as calculated by the i-Tree Canopy model.\n\nstanderr [Standard Error]\nThe Standard Error associated with the average canopy cover value as calculated by the i-Tree Canopy model.\n\nnumpts [Number of points]\nNumber of points completed for the i-Tree Canopy assessment of the ward.\n\nwarea [Ward area]\nThe area of the Ward boundary (m2) Attribution statement: Contains OS data \u00a9 Crown copyright [and database right] [year].",
