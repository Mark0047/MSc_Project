        "notes": "These documents are designed to provide a simple, easy to refer to analysis of the numbers of people, property and extent of land within areas at risk of flooding taken from the risk of flooding from rivers and sea (RoFRS) products. We use them in Environment Agency publications and reports; and to answer queries.\n\nWe use the Risk of Flooding from Rivers and Sea products and the National Receptor Dataset (NRD) 2023* to provide a breakdown of numbers and areas of land at risk of flooding within England, English Local Authorities, English MP Constituencies, Lead Local Flood Authorities and Environment Agency Partnership and Strategic Overview areas.  \n\nThere are 5 spreadsheets available which provide the following summary information:\n\u2022\tNumber of properties in areas at risk from flooding from rivers and sea\n\u2022\tNumber of people in areas at risk from flooding from rivers and sea\n\u2022\tNumber of deprived properties in areas at risk of flooding from rivers and sea\n\u2022\tChange in number of properties in areas at risk of flooding from rivers and sea (since previous update)\n\u2022\tChange in area of land at risk of flooding from rivers and sea (since previous update)\n\nFurther explanations about the information presented in the spreadsheets such as flood likelihood category, property types and how numbers are calculated are presented in the first tab of each spreadsheet.\n\nNOTES:\n\nWe have paused quarterly updates of this dataset. Please visit the \u201cPause to Updates of Flood Risk Maps\u201d announcement on our support pages for further information. We will provide notifications on the Check Your Long-Term Flood Risk website to indicate where we have new flood risk information.\n\n*NRD2023 was developed by the Environment Agency, however it is based on Ordnance Survey data (OS Address Base Premium) and we do not have permission to release as Open Data.
