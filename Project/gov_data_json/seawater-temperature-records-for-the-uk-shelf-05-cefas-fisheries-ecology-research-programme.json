Diurnal and seasonal changes in water temperature in South \nWales estuaries and saltmarshes. Data were collected in 1995 and 1996 from \nthree estuarine locations in South Wales during a study of the thermal \nexperience and tolerance of estuarine animals. The data comprise hourly \nrecords of temperature in brackish water where the depth is <1 metre at low \ntide. Three point locations in the Loughor Estuary, Oxwich Bay (Nicholstan \nPill) and Swansea Bay (Black Pill) in South Wales. Positions were Loughor (51\u00b0 \n37.82\u2019 N, 04\u00b0 13.54\u2019 W), Oxwich Bay (51\u00b0 34.18\u2019N, 04\u00b0 08.68\u2019W) and Swansea Bay \n(51\u00b0 35.92\u2019 N, 03\u00b0 59.61\u2019 W) (WGS84, Plate carr\u00e9e).",
