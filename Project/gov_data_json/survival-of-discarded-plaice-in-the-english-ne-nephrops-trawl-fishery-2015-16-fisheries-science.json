        "notes": "The primary objective of this project was to estimate the survival rate of \ndiscarded plaice caught in the NE *Nephrops* trawl fishery. \n\nAll tows took place in the North Sea at the southern edge of the Farne Deep \nfishing grounds (ICES Division IVb, ICES rectangles 39E8 or 38E8), in depths \nof 40-90m. The vessel used a 73m footrope otter trawl, with codend mesh sizes \nof 80 to 85mm, on muddy sand to target mixed demersal species but the main \ntarget catch was *Nephrops*, also known as prawn, scampi or langoustine \n(*Nephrops norvigicus*). Catches from two or three tows, of three hours in \nduration, were landed daily representing the normal activity of the fleet \nworking this area. The assessment was conducted during two fishing seasons in \nMarch 2015 and November to January 2016.",
