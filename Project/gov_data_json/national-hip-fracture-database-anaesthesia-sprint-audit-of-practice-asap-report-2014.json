        "notes": "The outcome of hip fracture serves as a key marker of the quality of hospital care across the many disciplines and departments who collaborate before, during and after this operation. \r\n\r\nHowever, the immediate physiological stress experienced by these patients is the pain and blood loss associated with the fracture. High quality anaesthetic care is crucial to the effective management of both stresses.\r\n\r\nClinicians interested in promoting better anaesthetic management of patients with hip fracture came together in 2007.  The Hip Fracture Perioperative Network (HipPeN) grew from this, and produced a report in 2010 highlighting wide variations in anaesthetic practice. \r\nHipPeN has since completed several projects \u2013 leading to publication of the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGB&I) guidelines on the anaesthetic management of hip fracture in 2012.\r\n\r\nThe National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD) is the largest hip fracture database in the world. \r\n\r\nThe database includes surgical and mortality data on a third of a million patients. It captures 95% of all new cases of hip fracture, with data from all hospitals in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands, and provides an ideal infrastructure for large audits.\r\n\r\nPublic funding was provided through the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP); the NHFD has now been incorporated into the Falls and Fragility Fracture Audit Programme (FFFAP) administered by the Royal College of Physicians (RCP).\r\n\r\nCollaboration between the AAGB&I and the NHFD culminated in this 2014 report which profiles approaches to peri-operative care across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. \r\n\r\nASAP set out to collect data on everyone over the age of 60 who had hip fracture surgery in hospitals across England, Wales and Northern Ireland between 1st  May and 31st July 2013. \r\n\r\nThe aim of ASAP was to profile individual hospitals\u2019 compliance with the standards for peri-operative care defined by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2011, and the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGB&I) in 2012.\r\n\r\nThe audit covers England, Wales, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, however data files only refer to data for England. \r\n",

HQIP is an independent organisation led by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, The Royal College of Nursing, and National Voices and it works in partnership with patients and healthcare professionals to influence and improve healthcare practice at all levels. \r\n\r\nHQIP commissions, manages, supports, and promotes national and local programmes of quality improvement. This includes the national clinical audit programmes, the Clinical Outcome Review Programmes and the National Joint Registry on behalf of NHS England and other healthcare departments and organisations.  \r\n\r\nIn compliance with its commissioning status, HQIP:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Uses best management and procurement practice to ensure robust results and actionable recommendations.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Ensures patients and carers remain at the heart of its work through continued, strategic involvement in all relevant processes and projects.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Supports professionals to review and improve their practice by providing education and training programmes, and opportunities to share best practice as part of promoting an integrated approach to quality improvement.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Works to inform and influence national healthcare policy by effectively communicating its work and that of its partners.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Encourages wide use of robust data for quality improvement of care, offering patient choice, promoting patient safety, supporting revalidation and service accreditation, commissioning, service redesign, and research.\r\n\r\nFurther information about the HQIP Board, the team, and the organisations that HQIP work with is available on the HQIP website at http://www.hqip.org.uk/about-us/.",
