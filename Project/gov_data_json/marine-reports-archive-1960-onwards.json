The reports which date from the 1960s onwards include the BGS Marine Reports Series, Marine Commercial reports and associated records, Palaeontology reports and other specialist reports. Examples of report types are data acquisition and processing reports, site investigation reports and interpretation reports. The reports are primarily for the UKCS (United Kingdom Continental Shelf). The coverage of some reports is the entire UKCS whilst other have only regional or very localised extent. The reports are applicable to a wide range of uses including environmental, geotechnical, geophysical and geological studies.",
