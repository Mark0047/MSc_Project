The indicator is defined in three parts: 1.Total number of primary fires per 100,000 population; 2.Total number of fatalities due to primary fires per 100,000 population; 3.Total number of non-fatal casualties (excluding precautionary checks and first aid cases) per 100,000 population; A primary fire is any fire involving property (including non-derelict vehicles) and/or casualties and/or involves 5 or more fire appliances. Good performance is typified by a lower rate.",
