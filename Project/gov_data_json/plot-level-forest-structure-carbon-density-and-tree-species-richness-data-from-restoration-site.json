        "notes": "This dataset consists of structure, biomass (carbon density) and biodiversity (plant species richness) from forest inventory plots at forest restoration sites in South and Southeast Asia and the code for the analyses of these data as conducted in Banin, Raine et al (2023). The recorded data consists of plot level censuses carried out up to May 2021 collated from published studies, grey literature and data provided by co-authors. This represents the collation of data from 11 sites in areas where disturbance had led to the clearance or degradation of natural forest. Plots where tree seedlings were planted (active restoration) and plots where no seedling planting took place (natural regeneration) were censused for structure, biomass and/or biodiversity. Some of the sites in the dataset also recorded data at old growth forest plots for reference, and/or provided repeat measures of forest metrics over time. The dataset also includes the code used for analysis of this plot level data, used to compare the outcome of different restoration approaches. Full details about this dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5285/3d3b1d09-9e7a-4144-b8a1-b09a3c573466",
