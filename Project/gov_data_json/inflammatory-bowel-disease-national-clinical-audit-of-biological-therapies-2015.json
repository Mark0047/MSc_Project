        "notes": "Data from the UK IBD audit requires careful interpretation and the information should not be looked at in isolation when assessing standards of care. The results should be interpreted within the context of the fact that many sites entered a relatively small number of cases to the audit and therefore all percentages should be viewed alongside the actual number of cases submitted. As a reflection of this a very small number of events can change percentages quite dramatically and hence caution is advised.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the biological therapies audit is to measure the efficacy, safety and appropriate use of biological therapies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease in the UK and to capture the views of patients on their quality of life at intervals during their treatment. This is a prospective audit with data collection taking place in \u2018real time\u2019 during the clinic appointment. Participating sites were asked to identify and enter data on patients newly started on biological therapies between 12 September 2011 and 28 February 2015.\r\n\r\nThese data do not include any data about individual patients nor does it contain any patient identifiable data. The remit of the UK IBD audit covers the whole of the UK, however data here are provided at \u2018site\u2019 level for all participating sites, in England only. The term \u2018site\u2019 refers to an IBD Service that may be run across one or more hospitals within an NHS organisation, therefore an NHS Trust in England can comprise of one or more sites.",
