Therefore, this only includes the overflow data for a small subset of Scottish Water overflows and the number of overflows included on the annual returns to SEPA may vary between years due to licence reporting requirements.\r\n\r\nThe data file provided contains the reported overflow event data submitted to SEPA for the last 5 calendar years (2019-2023).  This includes the overflow asset, measurement point and licence information as well as the start/stop time (dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss), duration ([h]:mm:ss] and volume (m3) for each discrete spill.\r\n\r\nThe data file also contains summary annual overflow event data at a measurement point level. This includes: Total spill number, Total duration and Total volume for each year and additional information such as Type of Overflow, Bathing Season Only Spills, Asset Postcode, Local Authority Area, X&Y (Easting & Northings) co-ordinates and Discharge Receiving Water.",
