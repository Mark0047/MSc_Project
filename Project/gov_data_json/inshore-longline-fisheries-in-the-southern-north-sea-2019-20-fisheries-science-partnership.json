The overall aims of this project were to examine i) the seasonal \ncatch rates of fish taken in the southern North Sea demersal longline fishery; \nii) catch composition of all discarded and retained fish; iii) vitality of \ncommercially important skate and ray species, focusing on thornback ray \n*Raja**clavata*; iv) post-release behaviour and discard survival of \ndiscarded thornback ray through an electronic tagging programme.\n\nOn each occasion longlines were deployed, the positional information, soak \ntimes, and number of hooks/baths were recorded, and for all species of fish \nlength distribution data were taken.\n\nFor electronically tagged fish the release date, release position and \nindividual length, wing width, sex and maturity were recorded.",
