These instruments gathered data for \n5 minutes every 30 minutes. Sensors were validated against in-situ samples \nduring deployment and recovery. Fluorometers were standardised using \nfluorosphere beads. Turbidity meters were calibrated using Stabical (Hach, \nUS). The moorings were also fitted with upward facing acoustic Doppler current \nprofilers (ADCP), this data is held by BODC.",
