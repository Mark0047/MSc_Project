        "notes": "HISTORIC DATASET. DO NOT USE FOR CURRENT ANALYSIS. Areas to Benefit is a spatial, polygon, displaying areas that would benefit from the presence of a new, or improvement of a current flood defence scheme as planned within the Medium Term Plan (i.e. covering the next 5 years: effectively a new dataset will be available annually).  It does not directly indicate the likelihood of flooding to individual properties.  The Environment Agency is supplying this data in order to support the Government\u2019s and Association of British Insurer\u2019s (ABI) revised joint Statement of Principles on the provision of flood insurance.  The areas defined within this dataset show a forecast of areas benefiting from new/improved flood defence projects. It contains funding allocation for the first financial year (from April). Funding for the following four financial years is not guaranteed being only indicative and will be reviewed annually. Projects within a Medium Term Plan qualify for this dataset if:\n\u2022\tthe investment leads to a change in the current standard of service (change projects);\n\u2022\tthe investment is a replacement or refurbishment in order to sustain the current standard of service (sustain projects);\n\u2022\tthe project has an initial construction budget of \u00a3100k of more; and\n\u2022\tthe project is included within the first five years of the MTP.\nThe data includes all the Environment Agency\u2019s projects over \u00a3100K that will change or sustain the standards of flood defence in England and Wales over the next 5 years.  It also includes the equivalent schemes for all Local Authority and Internal Drainage Boards.  The number of households and areas of land contributing to DEFRA\u2019s Outcome Measures (OM) are also attributed i.e. could benefit from major work on flood defences.\nThese data also contain Intermittence Flood Maintenance Programme that show the annual maintenance programme of work scheduled to be carried by the Environment Agency, Local Authority or Internal Drainage Board on flood defences.  Data details routine maintenance as well as intermittent work that has been funded for the coming year.  The data contains a start and end coordinate defining the relevant river section where work is planned.\nInformation Warning:\nPlease note that this data show the areas where investment is being made to reduce the flood and coastal erosion risk and are not detailed enough to account for individual addresses.  Individual properties may not always face the same risk of flooding as the areas that surround them. \nAlso note that funding figures are indicative and any use or interpretation should account for future updates where annual values may change.\nAttribution Statement: \u00a9 Environment Agency copyright and/or database right 2016.
