Designation is intended to protect areas of landscape, recreation, nature conservation and scientific interest which are strategically important. Any alterations to the boundary of MOL should be undertaken by Hackney through the LDF process, in consultation with the Mayor and adjoining authorities.  Land designated as MOL should satisfy at least one of the following criteria:\r\n- land that contributes to the physical structure of London by being clearly distinguishable from the built-up area\r\n- land that includes open air facilities, especially for leisure, recreation, sport, arts and cultural activities and tourism which serve the whole or significant parts of London\r\n- land that contains features or landscapes of historic, recreational, nature conservation or habitat interest, of value at a metropolitan or national level\r\n- land that forms part of a Green Chain and meets one of the above criteria.\r\n\r\nCreated over OS historic maps. Data has been digitised from paper maps. ",
