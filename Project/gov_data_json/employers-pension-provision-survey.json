        "notes": "Quantitative survey of employers carried out approximately every two years since 1994. Anonymised versions of the 2005 to 2011 datasets are held by DWP for analysis by pension analysts. The survey collects information on the extent and type of pension provision by GB private sector employers for their employees. The published research reports cover the proportions of firms providing pensions and the extent of employee membership of employer pension schemes. In respect of the nature of pension provision, the report covers the types of provision, joining mechanisms and contribution rates. The report also outlines the main reasons for provision or non-provision of pensions and examines recent and planned changes in provision. Most recent versions of the survey also look at employer intentions around the workplace pension reforms.",
