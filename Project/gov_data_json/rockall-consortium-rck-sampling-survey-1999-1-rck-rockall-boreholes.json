The purpose was to collect data as part of the Rockall Consortium to provide an insight into the largely undefined geology of the Hatton Bank and Faeroe Bank area and provide further calibration for seismic data in the west of Shetland area. Sample data (boreholes) were collected using wireline drilling equipment. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS report WB/19/16C. Geological details are contained in BGS report WB/99/21C.",
