The data enable the FCA to monitor developments in the market, for example, to gain insights into what action consumers take the first time they access a pension pot.\r\n\r\nThe FCA started collecting data from all regulated firms that provide retirement income products from 1 April 2018. The data the FCA collected and published for previous periods were drawn from a representative sample of firms. This update provides the latest data covering the year from April 2019 to March 2020. Some of the previously published data for the year April 2018 to March 2019 has been restated in this update due to firm resubmissions.",
