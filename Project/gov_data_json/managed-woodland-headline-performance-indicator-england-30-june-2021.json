It is recognised that there are\nother woodlands that could be considered to be 'managed'.\n\n1) Any English Woodland Grant Scheme (EWGS) Woodland Creation Grant (WCG)\nwhose first instalment payment date was < 15 years ago at the end of the reporting\nperiod.\n2) Any English Woodland Grant Scheme (EWGS) Woodland Management Grant\n(WMG) whose first instalment payment date was < 15 years ago at the end of the reporting period.\n3) Any English Woodland Grant Scheme (EWGS) Woodland Planning Grant (WPG)\nwhose first instalment payment date was < 15 years ago at the end of the reporting\nperiod.\n4) Any English Woodland Grant Scheme (EWGS) Woodland Improvement Grant\n(WIG) whose first instalment payment date was < 15 years ago at the end of the\nreporting period.\n5) Any Farm Woodland Premium Scheme (FWPS) and Farm Woodland Premium\n(FWP) whose scheme approval date was <15 years ago at the end of the reporting\nperiod.\n6) Any Woodland Grants Scheme Mk3 (WGS3) schemes that have been in contract\nin the 15 years up until the end of the reporting period.\n7) Any Felling Licence Applications (FLA) whose registration date was <15 years ago\nat the end of the reporting period.\n8) All Public Forest Estate land owned and/or managed by the Forestry Commission\nat the end of the reporting period.\n9) All woodland managed by the Defence Infrastructure Organisation department of the\nMOD classified as a Training Area.\n10) Any Countryside Stewardship Woodland Creation agreement whose first payment date was < 15 years ago at the end of the reporting period.\n\n\nEXCLUDED: EWGS Woodland Assessment Grant (WAG), EWGS Woodland\nRegeneration Grant (WRG), Forest Plans, Dedication, WGS2, WGS1 and Natural\nEngland\u2019s HLS.\n\nThe 'denominator' used for calculation of the indicator, i.e. the figure used as the entire\nwoodland area in England, was that obtained from the most recent version of the\nNational Forest Inventory (NFI) at the time of computation.\n\nThe administrative data sources are integrated to produce a single layer indicating woodland management status and this is provided as a georeferenced .tiff raster file here.\nCell values: 0 = Unmanaged woodland, 1 = Actively managed woodland.
