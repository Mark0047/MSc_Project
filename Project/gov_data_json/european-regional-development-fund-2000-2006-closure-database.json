Inaccurate media coverage of DCLG's liabilities in the 2009-10 accounts arising from 2000-06 ERDF Programme closure led to consideration of whether information on irregularities should be published.  This would have demonstrated that DCLG had the final responsibility for some of the irregularities and that not all of them were the result of unreasonable enforcement of regulations by the European Commission.  Advice from legal, data protection and communications colleagues at the time was that publication of such detail was inadvisable because of various legal and practical barriers.  The proposal then was that a more detailed explanation of the liabilities should be included in the press release accompanying the publication of DCLG's accounts which would not identify individual grant recipients but would list where the fault lay with the Department and where it lay with projects but could not be recovered.  This approach was agreed by David Rossington and Sir Bob Kerslake. "
