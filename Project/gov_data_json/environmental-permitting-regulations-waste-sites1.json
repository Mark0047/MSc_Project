Once we have issued a licence neither the activities nor the area of land may be changed unless the licence is modified.\nThe Environmental Permitting Regulations regulating waste sites came into force on 6 April 2008. The new regime combines a number of earlier permitting / licensing regimes. \nOther related datasets available are: \n- Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC)\n- Authorised Treatment Facilities (End of Life Vehicles)\n- Water Quality and Pollution Control (Discharge Consents)\n- Waste Electrical Electronic Equipment (WEEE)EPR Waste is the table for granted permits.\nEPR Waste Applications holds details of applications that did not or have not yet resulted in a permit or permit variation.
