        "notes": "This spreadsheet is the underlying data for the biodiversity indicator A1, Awareness, understanding and support for conservation.\n\nThe indicator addresses awareness of biodiversity and understanding of its value, concern about biodiversity loss, as well as support for performing actions that can help to conserve it.  It uses a hierarchical system to group people in the UK according to the extent to which they are aware of the threat to biodiversity in the UK, their level of concern about the loss of biodiversity and the number and type of actions they take to support and protect it.\n\nPeople who are highly engaged say that they are aware of the threat to biodiversity in the UK, they are concerned about the loss of biodiversity and they undertake actions that help to support and protect biodiversity.  In 2014, 6 per cent of people surveyed were highly engaged.  At the other end of the scale, 52 per cent of people surveyed said they were not aware of a threat to biodiversity in the UK.\n\nData for this indicator comes from questions on awareness of, concern for, and actions taken, to prevent biodiversity loss.  These questions have been inserted into surveys running in the four countries of the United Kingdom. \n\nThis is one of a suite of 24 UK biodiversity indicators published by JNCC on behalf of Defra; the latest publication date was 19 January 2016 - for indicator A1 the latest data are for 2014.  The supporting technical document details the methodology used to create the indicator.",
