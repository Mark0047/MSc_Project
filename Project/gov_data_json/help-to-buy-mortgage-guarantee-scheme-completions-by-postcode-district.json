        "notes": "The data in this data set was provided by HM Treasury and details mortgage completions on properties supported by Help to Buy: mortgage guarantee completions, by local authority, England. The data set covers the period 8 October 2013 to 30 June 2014.\n\nThe Help to Buy: mortgage guarantee scheme opened on 8 October 2013 and is available across the United Kingdom. Under the scheme the government offers lenders the option to purchase a guarantee on mortgage loans where the borrower has a deposit of between 5% and 20%. The scheme can be used for mortgages on both new build and existing homes, by first time buyers, home movers and those remortgaging.\r\nIn order to qualify for a loan supported by the Help to Buy: mortgage guarantee, there are a number of eligibility criteria which are set out in the scheme rules.\r\n\r\nThe guarantee compensates participating mortgage lenders for a portion of net losses suffered in the event of repossession. The guarantee applies down to 80% of the purchase value of the guaranteed property covering 95% of these net losses. The lender therefore retains a 5% risk in the portion of losses covered by the guarantee. This ensures that the lender retains some risk in every mortgage originated. For example, the scheme is not available on buy-to-let mortgages or second homes, and the property value must be \u00a3600,000 or less.\r\n\r\nOver the life of the scheme the government will make available up to \u00a312 billion of guarantees, which is sufficient to support up to \u00a3130 billion of high loan-to-value (LTV) mortgages.\r\n\r\nFor further information see  \r\n[Help to Buy: mortgage guarantee scheme Quarterly Statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/349540/help_to_buy_mortgage_guarantee_quarterly_statistics_020914.pdf).\r\n",
