It is intended to assist in the implementation of Policy WCS 16 of the Waste Core Strategy but is not and does not purport to be an official record of all waste management sites in the County. In particular, it does not replace the information held on the planning register.\r\nFor detailed information about individual sites and site boundaries relevant planning permissions should be referred to. However, a small proportion of waste management sites in the County does not have express planning permission and instead has established/lawful use rights. Where this is the case site history should be considered both as to the nature and extent of such rights and in defining the boundary.",
