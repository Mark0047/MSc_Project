These numbers are based on 100% extracts from the computer systems which administer the benefits/ schemes. The tables cover information such as age and gender of claimant, duration of their spell on benefit and geographical locations of claimants. For employment programmes, the tables cover starts, leavers and participants of the schemes.  There are two ways of using the Tool: to produce bespoke tabulations to your requirements; or use our \u201cone-click\u201d tables to give you an overview of the benefit or scheme in which you are interested",
