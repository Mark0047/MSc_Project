        "notes": "In 2002 baseline biological surveys were conducted at 13 saline lagoon sites in the Outer Hebrides.  The purpose of the study was to provide SNH with the necessary baseline information to form such a judgement on the condition of these sites.  A series of relocatable monitoring transects were established and detailed biological surveys were conducted at stations along the transects.  Details of species abundances and the nature of the substrate were noted and a photographic record was made.  Water samples were collected for salinity measurements and the isolating barriers that separate the lagoon from the sea were examined and photographed.",
