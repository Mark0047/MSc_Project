An Archive version of the Flood Map: Areas Benefitting from Flood Defences is available on request\r\nThe Flood Map is a spatial dataset that shows the areas across Wales that could be affected by flooding from rivers or the sea. It also shows flood defences and the areas that benefit from them. Flood Map is designed to raise awareness among the public local authorities and other organisations of the likelihood of flooding and to encourage people living and working in areas prone to flooding to find out more and take appropriate action. The Flood Map includes several layers of information, this layer is: Areas Benefiting from Flood Defences, which shows those areas that would benefit from the presence of defences in a 1 percent fluvial / 0.5 percent tidal flood event.\r\n    ",
