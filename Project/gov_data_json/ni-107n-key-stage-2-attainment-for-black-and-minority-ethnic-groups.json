Minority ethnic groups measured for the purposes of this indicator include any ethnic group where there are over 30 pupils from that group in any particular cohort. Pupils attainment is assessed in relation to the National Curriculum and pupils are awarded levels on the National Curriculum scale to reflect their attainment.  Good performance is typified by higher percentages accompanied by a narrowing of the attainment gap between minority ethnic pupils and all pupils.",
