        "notes": "The fishing vessel *Wendy Patricia* was chartered between August and \nOctober 2007 to carry out a potting survey and an acoustic survey in the mixed \ncrab and lobster fishery in an area off the northeast coast from the river \nTyne to Druridge Bay. The main objective was to investigate the population \nstructure of edible crabs in relation to the characteristics of the seabed. \nFishing positions were spread throughout the survey area but most stations \nwere in Whitley Bay and north of Newbiggin, corresponding to the pre-survey \npositions of the gear. Sidescan sonar and underwater video were used during \nthe acoustic survey to map ground types in proximity to the fishing positions. \nThe fishing survey took place in late August and early September and the \nacoustic survey was carried out in October.",
