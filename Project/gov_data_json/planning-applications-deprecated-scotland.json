        "notes": "'Development management' is the name given to the process of deciding planning applications and various other associated activities including enforcement of planning controls. For the purposes of planning applications, development in Scotland is put into one of three categories \u2013 'local', 'major' or 'national'. The different categories mean that applications are treated in a way which is suited to the size and complexity of the proposed development and the issues they are likely to raise. Most applications will be for 'local' developments. 'Major' developments include applications for 50 or more homes, certain waste, water, transport and energy-related developments, and larger retail developments. 'National' developments are specific projects which have been identified in the National Planning Framework because of their national importance. Scottish Ministers become involved in a small minority of cases, but only do so where it involves a matter of genuine national interest.\n\nThis dataset consists of 4 separate layers: \n\n1. Planning Applications - Weekly Lists (Points):\u00a0\u00a0A point layer showing an amalgamation of the current calendar year's weekly lists for all Scottish planning authorities in terms of applications registered and/or decided by a planning authority. This should be a complete dataset across Scotland using X/Y co-ordinates, UPRN or postcode as corresponding\u00a0geometry. This is categorised by application status, planning authority and date of weekly list.\n2. Planning Applications - Weekly Lists (Polygons):\u00a0A polygon layer showing an amalgamation of the current calendar year's weekly lists for most Scottish\u00a0planning\u00a0authorities in terms of\u00a0applications registered and/or decided by a planning authority. This is only for authorities that publish site boundary\u00a0mapping data online.\u00a0This is\u00a0categorised\u00a0by application status, planning authority and date of weekly list.\n3. Planning Applications - historic year data back to 1990 (Points):\u00a0A Point layer for all previous year's planning applications with summary details for\u00a0most\u00a0Scottish\u00a0planning\u00a0authorities. This is only for authorities that publish site boundary\u00a0mapping data online and is not complete across Scotland. NB. This layer can be filtered for individual year by selecting the 'shapefile' or 'GeoJSON' download option or the Web Feature Service can be filtered using appropriate software such as a desktop GIS.\n4. Planning Applications - historic year data back to 1990 (Polygons):\u00a0A polygon layer for all previous year's planning applications with summary details for\u00a0most\u00a0Scottish\u00a0planning\u00a0authorities.

This layer can be filtered for individual year by selecting the 'shapefile' or 'GeoJSON' download option or the Web Feature Service can be filtered using appropriate software such as a desktop GIS.\n\nThis data is collected and published weekly (for weekly lists) and this metadata record is updated weekly.\n\nWe strongly recommend that, when using the WFS for this dataset, because of it's size you should use it with a filter.\n\n*Moray's planning data has currently been removed from this dataset. We will find a solution to this in due course*",
