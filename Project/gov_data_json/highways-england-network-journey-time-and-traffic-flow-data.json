        "notes": "***1st July 2016 Update***\r\n\r\nWebTRIS Phase 1 is now available and can be accessed at http://webtris.highwaysengland.co.uk  \r\n\r\nWe are in the process of updating the way that traffic flow data is made available to our external users to replace the old TRADS website. The new platform will deliver a more modern experience, utilising Google Maps with count site overlays and bespoke downloadable reporting capabilities.  This new service will be referred to as \u2018WebTRIS\u2019.\r\n\r\nThe new development will contain all of the elements users are already familiar with; searching on Site ID\u2019s and reviewing reports based on Site ID\u2019s etc. but will also modernise the look and feel of the product and allow users to select an area of interest by clicking on a map. \r\n\r\nDevelopment began in early February 2016 and is expected to be complete in July 2016. \r\n\r\nThis is a Phase 1 release.  A Phase 2 development is planned to take into account user feedback.\r\n\r\nOn-going updates will be released here with videos showing the product as it grows. There will also be live demonstrations as the product nears go-live and opportunities to take part in User Acceptance Testing and feedback sessions.\r\n\r\nWe are working hard to improve the level of service that we provide and thank you for your patience while we do so.  We will keep you informed on progress with the next update due in May.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThis data series provides average journey time, speed and traffic flow information for 15-minute periods since April 2015 on all motorways and 'A' roads managed by Highways England, known as the Strategic Road Network, in England.\r\n\r\nJourney times and speeds are estimated using a combination of sources, including Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras, in-vehicle Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and inductive loops built into the road surface.\r\n\r\nPlease note that journey times are derived from real vehicle observations and imputed using adjacent time periods or the same time period on different days. Further information is available in 'Field Descriptions' at the bottom of this page.\r\n\r\nThis data replaces the data previously made available via the Hatris and Trads websites.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Traffic Flow and Journey Time data prior to April 2015 is still available on the HA Traffic Information (HATRIS) website which can be found at https://www.hatris.co.uk/",
