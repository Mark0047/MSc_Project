        "notes": "The primary aim of this Fisheries Science Partnership project was to monitor \nspatial movements of thornback ray (*Raja clavata*) from three inshore \nregions along the coast of East Anglia, with the prospect of understanding \nstock structure in ICES Division IVc better. Additional data were collected on \ncatch rates, size and sex composition, maturity stage, health condition and \nclasper length (males). Three study sites were chosen and surveyed:\n\n\n(  1.)Lincolnshire to Northwest Norfolk (Skegness to Wells)\n(  2.)Northeast Norfolk (Blakeney to Great Yarmouth)\n(  3.)South Suffolk (Felixstowe to Lowestoft).",
