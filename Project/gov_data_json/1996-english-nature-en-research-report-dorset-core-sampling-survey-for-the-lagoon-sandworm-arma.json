In addition a third site in Portland Harbour was also sampled. Infaunal species were sampled, from each separate habitat by taking four 0.01m2 core samples to a depth of 20cm at each of the three survey sites. Material retained on a 0.5mm sieve for each site was combined as a sample, per habitat, and subsequently identified by Dr Peter Garwood. Specimens collected during the survey were identified in the lab by Dennis Seaward. Positional information was gathered using a hand-held GPS and converted into OS grid references, as stated in the report. Some slides were taken from this survey and are held in the Maritime Team's slide collection at Northminster House.",
