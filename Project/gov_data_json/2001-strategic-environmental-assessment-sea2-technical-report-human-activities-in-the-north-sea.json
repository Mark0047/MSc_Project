The SEA2 areas cover the Northern North Sea (NNS), the Central North Sea (CNS) and the Southern North Sea (SNS). The activities include shipping, energy (both existing oil and gas developments and renewable energy), telecommunications, military activities, waste disposal, dredging and aggregate extraction, marine archaeological sites and wrecks. Commercial fishing is the subject of a separate report.",
