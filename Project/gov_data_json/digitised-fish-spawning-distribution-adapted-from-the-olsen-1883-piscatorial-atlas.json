Olsen's Atlas (\n`https://wellcomecollection.org/works/up4zvcsn`_) based on their relevance to \nthe present day spawning datasets and commercial importance: cod, haddock, \nherring, lemon sole, mackerel, plaice, sole, whiting, skate, thornback ray, \nling, horse mackerel, hake and sprat (general distribution only). The majority \nof the Olsen (1883) maps were for species either no longer considered in a \nlarge commercial capacity in UK waters (e.g. anchovy, garfish, tusk etc.) \nand/or had no comparative present day dataset available (e.g. mussels, turbot \netc.).
