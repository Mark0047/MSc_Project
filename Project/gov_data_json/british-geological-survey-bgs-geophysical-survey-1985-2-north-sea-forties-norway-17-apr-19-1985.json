The purpose was to collect data as part of the UK continental shelf survey programme. The objectives were to investigate igneous bodies in the Forties area and acquire gravity and magnetic data along BIRPS deep seismic lines. Sea floor data were collected using echosounder. Gravity and Magnetometer data were recorded. These records are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS report WB/89/8R.",
