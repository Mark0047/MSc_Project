        "notes": "This is an overview of geographical cash access coverage in the UK at the end of the second quarter (April to June) of 2023. This monitoring forms part of the FCA\u2019s work on access to cash.\r\n\r\nEach quarter, with the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR), the FCA gathers and updates data on access to cash. This captures the locations of cash access points and other relevant information such as temporary closures, opening hours, and accessibility. This data covers brick-and-mortar, mobile bank, and building society branches, automated teller machines (ATMs), and the Post Office network. The FCA supplements this information with annual data on cashback locations.\r\n\r\nThe FCA estimates that for access to larger banks and building societies providing Personal Current Accounts (PCA) and Post Office: all branches, including mobile bank branches:\r\n\r\n* 97.4% of the UK urban population are currently within 1 mile of a free-to-use cash access point offering deposits\r\n \r\n* 98.2% of the UK rural population are currently within 3 miles of a free-to-use cash access point offering deposits\r\n\r\nWe estimate that for access to any bank, building society, Post Office branch, or any free ATM:\r\n\r\n* 99.3% of the UK urban population are currently within 1 mile of a free-to-use cash access point offering withdrawals\r\n \r\n* 98.6% of the UK rural population are currently within 3 miles of a free-to-use cash access point offering withdrawals",
