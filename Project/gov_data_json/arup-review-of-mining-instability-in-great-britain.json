The data has been converted to a digital format (ESRI shape file) by BGS in 1995. The original scale of the data was 1km square. The dataset has limited attribution indicating type i.e. metalliferous, rock, coal, deneholes (chalk), evaporites or ironstone, and whether definitive evidence was found. Although every effort has been made to attribute the digital data to the original maps some inconstancies may have arisen due to data conversion process.",
