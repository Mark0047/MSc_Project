Latitude and Longitude of each specific sample is listed in the datafile. Samples were measured on the Thermal Ionising Mass Spectrometer at the University of Oxford and have been drift corrected between 1st January 2023 and 30th September 2024. They are the final, complete record of the data. The data has an external error of 0.03 per mil and is deemed reproducible. Ethan Petrou is responsible for collection and processing of the data and can be contacted. The data was collected to increase the number of barium isotope measurements in the modern oceans and would be useful for any modern oceanography or geochemist interested in redox or paleoproductivity.",
