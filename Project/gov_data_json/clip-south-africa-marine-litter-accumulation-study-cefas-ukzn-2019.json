The file \nSouth_Africa_Marine_Litter_Data.csv contains data on marine litter found \nduring beach surveys in Umhlanga (north of Durban) and Amanzimtoti (south of \nDurban) in South Africa in September 2019. The number of items and the weight \nin kg is reported for each litter category. Each survey is named with the \nname of the location plus a capital letter between A and L for Amanzimtoti; \nand between A and K for Umhlanga. The capital letter indicates the order of \nthe returning surveys at the same site. The list of item categories was obtain \nmerging OSPAR and Tangaroa Blue protocols with the addition of region-specific \nitems. Item categories marked with '*' were added during the operations in \nSouth Pacific, item categories marked with '**' were added during the \noperations in Belize, and item categories marked with '***' were added during \nthe operations in South Africa. An array of metadata (location names, survey \ndate, GPS coordinates in decimal degrees) is also reported per each data \npoint. \n\nThe file South_Africa_Marine_Litter_Metadata.csv reports other metadata \ncollected during the surveys following the OSPAR protocol to describe \nfactors potentially influencing litter characteristics. A READ-ME text file \ncontains a legend of the columns of the csv files.",
