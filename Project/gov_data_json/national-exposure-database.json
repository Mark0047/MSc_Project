The majority of visit records contain sampling data points. The number of sampling data points held in NEDB is about a million. The information relates to air concentration, breathing zone exposure levels and total exposure burden (contribution through inhalation, skin and ingestion) information using biological samples - exhaled breath, urine and/or blood as appropriate. NEDB does not store names of individuals who were subjected to sampling. However, a given anonymised air sampling data can be linked to an individual\u2019s name through the original visit record held in HSE\u2019s internal electronic records system.\nThe recorded information includes: Occupier name and Address, Date of visit, Industry, process and job, Substances sampled and their concentration, Sample type (breathing zone; static or biological), Exposure modifier information.",
