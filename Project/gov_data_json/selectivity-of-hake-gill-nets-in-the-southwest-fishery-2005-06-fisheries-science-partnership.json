The \nexperiment was carried out by comparing the catches in nets of mesh size 80, \n100, 120 and 140mm deployed simultaneously at two fishing grounds. Additional \n120mm nets were shot to obtain further data on size composition of hake. The \nwork was carried out in October and November 2005, using the vessel *Carol \nH.*",
