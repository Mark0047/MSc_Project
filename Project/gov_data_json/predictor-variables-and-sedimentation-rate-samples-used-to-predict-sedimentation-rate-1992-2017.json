        "notes": "Input data used to predict sedimentation rate for the Baltic Sea. Observation \ndata includes: Sedimentation rate data derived from isotope 137Cs tracers and \npseudo-samples of zero sedimentation rate randomly placed in areas of rocky \nhabitat. Sixteen predictor variables were considered for use in the \nsedimentation rate model. These were: Bathymetric Position Index (at three \nneighbourhood sizes); the Standard Deviation of bathymetry (at three \nneighbourhood sizes); Distance from Rivers (three layers representing \ndifferent river catchment sizes); Substrate class (developed at a 1:1,000,000 \nscale for the Baltic Sea, classified to Folk5 level); satellite derived \nestimate for Suspended Particulate Matter in the water column (a winter and \nsummer layer); Orbital Velocity at the seabed (a winter and summer layer); and \nCurrent Speed (a winter and summer layer).\n\nTo access and download the data contact `data.manager@cefas.co.uk`_\n\nFor additional details regarding the predictor data variables see the \npublication associated with this data: \n`https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2020.104325`_\n\n\n\n\n.. _`data.manager@cefas.co.uk`:\n    mailto:data.manager@cefas.co.uk%20\n\n.. _`https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2020.104325`:\n    https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2020.104325",
