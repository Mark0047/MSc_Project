        "notes": "Forest Reproductive Material (FRM) is the generic name for the seeds, cones, cuttings and planting stock used in forest establishment.  The 46 tree species and the genus Populus (including aspen, black poplar and grey poplar) covered by the Regulations are known as the \u201ccontrolled species\u201d.  The Forest Reproductive Material (Great Britain) Regulations 2002 regulate the marketing of FRM.  These Regulations came into force on 1st January 2003 and implement EC Directive 1999/105.  The Forestry Commission is the Official Body that is\nresponsible for the FRM Regulations in England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nThe Forestry Commission maintains the National Register of Approved Basic Material for Great Britain (The National Register).  Each entry of basic material (or unit of approval) in the National Register is given a unique register reference that encodes:\n        Species name \n        Type of basic material \n        Category of reproductive material to be produced \n        Region of provenance \n        Native seed zone (where appropriate) \n        Altitude zone (if the species is native to GB) \n        Origin (that part of the species\u2019 natural range from which the material \n        derives).  \n\nThe attributes of each polygon in this dataset are restricted to the National Register Identification Number (NRID), a national grid reference (NGR), a Basic Material 'category' symbol and the land area, in hectares.  All other details mentioned above are available in the National Register.  \n\nBasic Material is the plant material from which the Forest Reproductive Material (FRM) is derived and includes seed stands, seed orchards, parent material held by tree breeders in archives, individual clones and mixtures of clones. There are six types of basic material: \n\nSeed sources: \nThis covers all material from a single tree to any collection of trees within a region of provenance or seed zone.\nStands:\nSpecifically identified areas or groups of trees with identified boundaries .\nSeed orchards:  \nSources based upon known individuals derived from tree breeding. \nParents of families:\nSources based upon known individuals derived from tree breeding. \nClones: \nIndividually identified trees from which the FRM will be produced through vegetative propagation .\nClonal mixtures:\nIndividually identified trees from which the FRM will be produced through vegetative propagation. \n\nForest Reproductive Material (FRM) is cones, fruits and seeds, all parts of plants obtained by vegetative propagation, including embryos and plants produced from any of these.  Normally, only FRM that comes from registered basic material can be marketed.  There are four categories of reproductive material according to the basic material from which it is collected and these are recorded in this dataset:\nSource identified FRM (symbol SI):\nComes from general or specific locations within a single region of provenance or seed zone altitude band in which no specific superior qualities are recognised. \nSelected FRM (symbol SE):\nCollected from stands showing superior characteristics, e.g. better form, growth rate and health. \nQualified FRM (symbol QU):\nDerived from the selection of superior individual trees which have not undergone any form of testing. \nTested FRM (symbol TE):\nDerived from the selection of individual trees or stands that have undergone evaluation for genetic quality or have been shown to be superior, in comparison to accepted standards.",
