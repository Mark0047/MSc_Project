        "notes": "[This dataset is embargoed until March 12, 2026]. The data resource consists of soil chemical measurements for two aims: 1) to characterise soils of plots where we conducted management experiences to restore secondary forests affected by invasions, and 2) to assess the impacts of tree invasions on the chemical parameters of soils., by comparing native and invaded forest plots. All plots were established on invaded sub-tropical mountain secondary forests (Yungas) in the Horco Molle experimental reserve and Parque Sierra de San Javier (Horco Molle), Tucum\u00e1n, Argentina. For the first aim, we took samples from the six plots established in July 2020. Each plot is 240 metres by 140 metres, 3.36 hectares for each plot (location specified in the related dataset); for the second aim, we included plots that belong to the Red Subtropical de Parcelas Permanentes (Ceballos et al., 2022 ). Those plots are 1 ha each (100 m by 100 m) and were established in 1991, and trees are censused every five years. At each plot, we took samples at five random points (seven for the objective 1). At each point, we collected litter and soil at three different depths (0-10, 10-30, 30-50 cm) for posterior physical (bulk density) and chemical determination (organic carbon, total nitrogen, extractable phosphorus, cation exchange capacity, exchangeable cations calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium, pH) in the laboratory. The work was carried out as part of NERC-GCB grant 2022GCBCCONTAIN- Invasive alien species management to decrease impacts on biodiversity, rural poverty and carbon storage.
