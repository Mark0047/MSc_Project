        "notes": "This data set contains annual data and the most recent quarterly data on house building starts. From 2011/12 imputed data is included. Imputed data should not be seen as an estimate for the individual authority but is given on an authority basis to allow custom totals to be constructed. \r\n\n\nHouse building data are collected at local authority district level, but it is important to treat figures at this level with care. House building is unevenly distributed both geographically and over time and patterns of housing development can produce clusters of new homes which make the figures at a low geographic level volatile and difficult to interpret.\r\n\r\nFor detailed definitions of all tenures, see definitions of housing terms on Housing Statistics\t\t\r\n\r\nThe district level and county figures are as reported by local authorities and the NHBC. Where a local authority has not submitted a quarterly return to DCLG, no figure has been presented for this local authority (and when relevant its county) for any 12-month period that includes the missing quarter.\t\t\r\n\r\nEngland total figures include estimates for missing data returns from independent Approved Inspectors and Local Authorities, so the sum of district values may be slightly less than the England totals.\r\n\r\n*House building starts* -  A dwelling is counted as started on the date work begins on the laying of the foundation, including 'slabbing' for houses that require it, but not including site preparation. Thus when foundation work commences on a pair of semi-detached houses two houses are counted as started, and when work begins on a block of flats all the dwellings in that block are counted as started. The starts of houses in building schemes are usually phased over a period of weeks or even, in very large schemes, months.\r\n\r\n*Tenure* \u2013 For the purposes of these statistics, the term tenure refers to the nature of the organisation responsible for the development of a new housing start or completion. It does not necessarily describe the terms of occupancy for the dwelling on completion. For example, some housing associations develop homes for sale on the open market. Such homes would be reported in the Housing Association tenure of these statistics, but would ultimately most likely be owned and occupied in the private sector.\r\n\r\n*Housing association* - \u201cHousing associations (HAs)\u201d is used as the generic name for all social landlords not covered by local authorities (see below). In previous editions HAs were referred to as Registered Social Landlords (RSL), and the technical term (private) Registered Provider (pRP) of social housing is also sometimes used. The more all-encompassing description of \u2018housing associations\u2019 is now seen as more helpful to users of these statistics.\r\n\r\nThese data were derived from live table [253a](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/639541/LiveTable_253a.xlsx) (quarterly figures).\r\n",
