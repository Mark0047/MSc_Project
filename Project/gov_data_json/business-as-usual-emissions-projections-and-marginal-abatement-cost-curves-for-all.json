        "notes": "These are inputs into the BEIS Carbon Price Models, which are used for analysis, including for estimating impacts on the carbon price of policy changes, and for producing BEIS's updated short-term traded carbon values for modelling purposes and for public policy appraisal. Updated short-term traded carbon values for modelling purposes have been used in the latest update to BEIS\u2019s Energy and Emissions projections (EEP) and will be used in other models of electricity generation and investment across government. BEIS\u2019s short-term traded carbon values for UK public policy appraisal are used for valuing the impact of government policies on emissions in the traded sector, that is those sectors covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). These data are not released: they are commercial in nature because they have been produced for the Department by external contractors under commercial contract.",
