        "notes": "Stands surveyed to determine whether Chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) and/or Chestnut gall wasp (Dryocosmus kuriphilus) are present in 17 forest stands of Sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) located across seven forest districts in England a Wales.  There are no comercial stands of chestnut in Scotland \nThe EU Plant Health Directive was amended in 2005 to recognise a new protected zone within the Community in respect of Cryphonectria parasitica, the cause of Sweet Chestnut blight (Commission Directive 2005/18/EC of 2nd March 2005). At the same time it was decided to set up a monitoring programme for Dryocosmus kuriphilus, the oriental chestnut gall wasp (Commission Decision 2006/464/EC); which is considered as a likely plant health risk.\nThese changes to the EU Plant Health Directive will impact on movements of wood and bark of Castanea sativa (Sweet Chestnut) within the EU Member states, unless they have been granted Protected Zone (PZ) status. This is in response to a gradual spread of C. parasitica in continental Europe and pressure on the EU to change the status of this disease. The Directive recognises the UK (including the Channel Islands but not the Isle of Man) as one of the Protected Zones. As a result, plant passporting controls throughout the EU will, from 15th May, be confined to plants for planting; with plant passport controls applying to wood (unless stripped of bark) and isolated bark moving into and within the protected zones. In order to maintain our PZ status, and controls on movements of wood and bark of C. sativa, we are obliged to carry out annual surveys to demonstrate continued freedom from this disease.\nNo surveyed trees showed symptoms of Chestnut blight or Chestnut gall wasp.\n\nCount  -  Number of sites surveyed in grid square\n\nYear - Year in which sites were surveyed.
