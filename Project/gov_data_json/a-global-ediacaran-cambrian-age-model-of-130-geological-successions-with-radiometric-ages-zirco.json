        "notes": "We present new age models for the Ediacaran-Cambrian which lacks a robust global temporal framework. This interval marks the radiation of animals, but there are major uncertainties in the evolutionary dynamics of this critical radiation and its relationship to changes in palaeoenvironmental changes. Here we present global data from 130 successions that enable us to create four new possible global age models (A to D) for the interval 551\u2013517 million years ago (Ma). These models comprise composite carbonate carbon isotope (\u03b413Ccarb) curves, which are anchored to radiometric ages and consistent with strontium isotope chemostratigraphy, and are used to calibrate metazoan distribution in space and time. These models differ most prominently in the temporal position of the basal Cambrian negative \u03b413Ccarb excursion (BACE). Two age models (A and B) place the BACE within the Ediacaran, and yield an age of ~538.8 Ma for the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary; however models C and D appear to be the most parsimonious and may support a recalibration of the boundary age by up to 3 Myr younger. All age models reveal a previously underappreciated degree of variability in the terminal Ediacaran, incorporating notable positive and negative excursions that precede the BACE. Nothwithstanding remaining uncertainties in chemostratigraphic correlation, all models support a pre-BACE first appearance of Cambrian-type shelly fossils in Siberia and possibly South China, and show that the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition was a protracted interval represented by a series of successive radiations. Data were compiled by Fred Bowyer, with support from Andrey Yu. Zhuravlev, Rachel Wood, Maoyan Zhu, Graham Shields, Ying Zhou, Chuang Yang, Simon Poulton, Dan Condon, Andrew Curtis.",
