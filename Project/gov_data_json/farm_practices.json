Holdings were targeted by farm type and size to ensure a representative sample. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThresholds were applied to ensure that very small holdings with little agricultural activity were not included in the survey. To be included in the sample, holdings had to have at least 50 cattle, 100 sheep, 100 pigs, 1,000 poultry or 20 hectares of arable crops or orchards. Therefore results are national estimates that reflect only on the 60 thousand holdings that exceed these thresholds.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nFor more details of survey methodology and analysis please refer to the Survey details section within the Statistical Release on the Farm Practices Survey webpage:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/collections/farm-practices-survey\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nFarm size\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe farm size bands used within these detailed results tables are shown below.

This includes all arable and horticultural crops, temporary and permanent grassland, sole right rough grazing, woodland, land used for outdoor pigs and uncropped arable land. The farmed area used in the latest nutrient management section is taken from the 2014 June Survey of Agriculture and Horticuture.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nData revisions\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nIn 2013 the 2012 results by farm size were reproduced for some sections - marked with a footnote. This was due to some holdings previously being classified into the incorrect size band. Although the number of responses used in each size band has changed the changes seen in the survey results have not been statistically significant unless indicated in each table. No revisions have occurred since.\t\r\n\r\nIf you require the datasets in a more accessible format, please contact farming-statistics@defra.gsi.gov.uk \t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t",
