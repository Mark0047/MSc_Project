        "notes": "This dataset contains video (841 mp4) and photograph (8674 jpg) data of soft and hard coral communities from Thailand, Japan and Fiji. These data were collected in order to be used to construct 3d models of the coral forests and reefs. The 3D models were creating by extracting stills from the video, and supplementing with added photographs, then using Agisoft metashape to make the photogrammetric reconstructions of the coral communities (as *.psx files). These data will be used to reconstruct the community ecology using spatial point process analyses and Bayesian network inference. There are 128 models from 8 sites taken across 25 days from Phi Phi Islands, Phuket, Thailand. The Thailand models consist of videos taken with a variety of different techniques, and were an exercise in honing the methods of data collection, rather than taking data to be used. There are 14 models from four sites in Okinawa and Shikoku Islands, Japan across 4 days. There are 47 models from nine sites in Rainbow Reef, Tavenui, Fiji across 13 days. This data set is part of an project to understand the eco-evolutionary dynamics of early animal communities using ecological approaches with this data providing modern analogue communities.",
