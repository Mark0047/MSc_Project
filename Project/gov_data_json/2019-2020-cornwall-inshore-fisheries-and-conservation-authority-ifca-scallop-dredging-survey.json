        "notes": "Cornwall Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority (CIFCA) is the authority responsible for the sustainable management of sea fisheries in the Cornwall IFCA district, which extends to 6 nautical miles from coastal baselines. Dredging for king scallops in the Cornwall IFCA district is currently subject to a number of byelaws, including; Shellfish Boats Byelaw, Scallop Dredge (Limited Fishing Time) byelaw and Methods of Fishing (Dredges) byelaw. These byelaws limit boat size to 16.46m in the district, prohibit scallop dredging between 7pm and 7am and stipulate gear requirements, including a limit of 12 dredges per vessel at any one time. Cornwall IFCA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s research team are preparing to start annual dredge tow surveys for scallops within the district. Currently the proposal is to conduct annual survey tows at a number of inshore sites within the district which were previously regularly surveyed by CEFAS along with some new sites. Data from these surveys, in conjunction with the larger current Cefas Stock Assessment program, would help to guide management of this fishery in inshore waters.\n     Cornwall IFCA carried out this survey in preparation to start annual dredge tow surveys for scallops within the district. Currently the proposal is to conduct annual survey tows at a number of inshore sites within the district which were previously regularly surveyed by CEFAS along with some new sites. Data from these surveys, in conjunction with the larger current Cefas Stock Assessment program, would help to guide management of this fishery in inshore waters.\n     The aim of the project was to develop a suitable method for repeat surveying for scallops from R/V Tiger Lily, to be used in multiple locations.\n     The objectives of the survey were to trial the effectiveness of the N-Virodredge and tow bar for dredging for scallops from R/V Tiger Lily, to obtain measurement of all scallops (P. maximus) collect and to trial identifying and measuring the growth rings on individual scallop shells for ageing purposes. \n     In 2019, five tows were completed with a total of 74 scallops recorded. In 2020, a total of nine tows were completed with a total of 105 scallops recorded.",
