        "notes": "We have collected data on the retirement income market since April 2015. The data helps us monitor developments. For example, it gives us insight into the actions consumers take the first time they access a pension pot.\r\n\r\nPreviously published data up to March 2018 is also included in separate tables. The data for these periods was initially drawn from a representative sample. We started collecting data from all regulated firms that provide retirement income products from 1 April 2018. This change means users should be careful if comparing the more complete data to data from before April 2018.\r\n\r\n##What\u2019s included in the data\r\n* Numbers and types of pension plans accessed for the first time.\r\n* Number of plans where the plan holder made a regular or ad hoc partial withdrawal.\r\n* Use of advice when purchasing retirement products.\r\n* Types of annuity options sold.\r\n* Sources of business for retirement product providers.\r\n* Number of defined benefit (DB) to defined contribution (DC) pension transfers received.\r\n* Total value withdrawn by Pension Commencement Lump Sum (PCLS) and by all fully encashed plans.\r\n* Stock data and advice on drawdowns. This can be found in the underlying tables 19,19A, 19B, 19C and 20.",
