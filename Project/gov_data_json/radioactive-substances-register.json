The Radioactive Substances Act 1993 (RSA 93) regulates the keeping and use of radioactive materials, and the disposal and accumulation of radioactive waste. Any person who keeps or uses radioactive material must either be registered or subject to an exemption.\r\nIn addition to registration of premises, special provisions are made for mobile radioactive apparatus. Such equipment must be registered wherever it is kept, used, lent or hired, unless covered by an exemption.\r\nAny person who disposes of radioactive waste (or accumulates such waste for disposal) must either be authorised or subject to an exemption. The Environment Agency regulates these registrations and authorisations.\r\nThe Radioactive Substances Register data is provided in 3 tables: \r\nActive_RAS_Auths contains details of active authorisations, \r\nActive_RAS_Regs contains active registrations All_RAS_Auths_and_Regs contains details of all authorisation and registration applications, as well as effective, altered and revoked permissions. \r\nThe 'Active' tables are subsets of the 'All' table.
