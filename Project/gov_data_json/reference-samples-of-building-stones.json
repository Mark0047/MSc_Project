The sample coverage extends across the whole of the UK and supplements material in the Keyworth BGS BRITROCKS collection (Petrological Collection Database). The data included with the samples includes quarry and building locations and relevant lithostratigraphic information. The collection is ongoing and new material is added on a regular basis. The collection was created to mitigate the massive gap in knowledge resulting from the non-transferral of the main BGS Building Stone Collection to Keyworth from the Geological Museum in London, when the original move by BGS from London took place. The samples have been collected to assist in the sourcing, identification and matching of buildings stones from historic buildings throughout the UK. The collection provides essential support for the numerous enquiries the BGS receives through its GEOREPORTS Building Stone Assessment programme.",
