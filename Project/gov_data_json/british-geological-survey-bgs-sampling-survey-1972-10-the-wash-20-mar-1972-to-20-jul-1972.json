        "notes": "This marine sampling survey undertaken by Institute of Geological Sciences (BGS) took place March to July 1972 in The Wash on board the fishing vessel Aurora. These data are archived by BGS. Seabed samples and cores were collected using a shipek grab, gravity corer and vibrocorer (1.6m barrel), 235 stations were occupied, a further 230 stations were sampled by landing parties on drying banks, a further 297 stations were accessed by SRN-5 hovercraft. Samples assigned to this survey were also collected from the MV Whitethorn in December 1971 and December 1972. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS Internal Report WB/ MG/72/ 45 and WB/MG/74/030. The Wash survey interpretation and maps contained in IGS report 78/18.",
