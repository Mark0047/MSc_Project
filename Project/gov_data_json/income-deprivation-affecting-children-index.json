The Living Environment domain combines 4 indicators to give an overall score for the level of deprivation in the quality of the local environment. The indicators used in the latest update of this domain are; - Social and private housing in poor condition - Houses without central heating - Air quality - Road traffic accidents involving injury to pedestrians and cyclists More information about this domain can be found in Chapter 2, Section 8 of the English Indices of Deprivation 2007 Report.",
