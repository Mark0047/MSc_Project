        "notes": "This dataset is a subset of the \"WFD Classification Status Cycle 2\" product and contains classification data for the sub element Priority Substances (abbreviated to PS) as used in the assessment for Chemical status for the water framework directive (WFD). The data is presented as a row per individual WFD water body. WFD provides for measures against chemical pollution of surface waters which included the selection and regulation of substances of European Union (EU)-wide concern called the priority substances. The list of priority substances was selected from amongst those presenting a significant risk to or via the aquatic environment at EU level. This sub element is based on the classification of the individual elements identified as Priority Substances within the larger list of  Priority Substances and Certain Other Pollutants according to Annex II of Directive 2008/105/EC. The classification for the individual elements are assessed as either Good or fail. The PS classification is then based on a one out all out process meaning if a single PS element fails then the PS sub element classification will fail. If there are no individual PS elements in classification the PS sub element result is listed as does not require assessment (DRNA).
