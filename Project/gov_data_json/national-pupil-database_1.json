The data includes detailed information about pupils\u2019 test and exam results, prior attainment and progression at each key stage for all state schools in England.  The department also holds attainment data for pupils and students in non-maintained special schools, sixth form and further education colleges and (where available) independent schools.\r\nThe NPD also includes information about the characteristics of pupils in the state sector and non-maintained special schools such as their gender, ethnicity, first language, eligibility for free school meals, awarding of bursary funding for 16-19 year olds, information about special educational needs and detailed information about any absences and exclusions.\r\nExtracts of the data from NPD can be shared (under strict terms and conditions) with named bodies and third parties who, for the purpose of promoting the education or well-being of children in England, are:-\r\n\u2022 Conducting research or analysis\r\n\u2022 Producing statistics; or\r\n\u2022 Providing information, advice or guidance.\r\nThe department wants to encourage more third parties to use the data for these purposes and produce secondary analysis of the data.\r\nAll applications go through a robust approval process and those granted access are subject to strict terms and conditions on the security, handling and use of the data, including compliance with the Data Protection Act.  Anyone requesting access to the most sensitive data will also be required to submit a business case.\r\nMore information on the application process including the User Guide, Application Form, Security Questionnaire and a full list of data items available can be found from the NPD web page at:- https://www.gov.uk/national-pupil-database-apply-for-a-data-extract\r\n",
