        "notes": "The data published within this resource represents an ongoing pilot project of automated surface conditioning survey which is helping to extend the life of the UK\u2019s public infrastructure assets.                                         \r\n          \r\nAlthough the data represents a snapshot in time of the road conditions around the city, due to the evolving nature of the project and the technology around it the data may be updated at any time to reflect any additional data development.   \r\nDue to the nature of the underlying data, the association of pavement to street name represents just an approximation, with various level of accuracy across the dataset.                                                         \r\n\r\nThe City of York Council is continuously developing new technologies to improve the way in which the services provided by the council are delivered. The data published within this resource is used towards ongoing complex analysis in order to provide better deterioration and financial modelling techniques to help in ensuring more effective maintenance of roads and pavements, as well as to improve the way in which the maintenance is prioritised across the city.          \r\n    \r\nThe data records five condition categories:                                \r\n\r\n\u2022\tGrade 1: very good                                                                       \r\n\u2022\tGrade 2: good                                                                       \r\n\u2022\tGrade 3: fair                                                                       \r\n\u2022\tGrade 4: poor                                                                       \r\n\u2022\tGrade 5: very poor                                                                       \r\n\r\nFor information on road condition please visit the [__Road Condition Survey 2021__](https://data.yorkopendata.org/dataset/road-condition-survey-2021) dataset.",
