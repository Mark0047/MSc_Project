These \ncharts provide annual and monthly fisheries statistics at a fine spatial scale \nfor the period 1913-81 (excluding both World Wars). More specifically, they \nshow the annual and monthly landings and catch rates per fish species, and the \nfishing effort for various components of the British commercial fishing fleet. \nThese values are indicated separately for each rectangle of 1\u00b0 longitude by \n30' latitude (equivalent to International Council for the Exploration of the \nSea [ICES] rectangles) as well as for the entire area charted (generally \nequivalent to ICES fishing areas).",
