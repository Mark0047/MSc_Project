        "notes": "\n      The surface water flood maps give an indication of the broad areas likely to be at risk of surface water flooding.  This includes flooding that takes place from the surface runoff generated by rainwater (including snow and other precipitation) that:\n(a) is on the surface of the ground (whether or not it is moving), and\n(b) has not yet entered a watercourse, drainage system or public sewer.\nThe Flood Map for Surface Water pick out natural drainage channels, rivers, low areas in floodplains, and flow paths between buildings. But it does not indicate flooding caused by local rainfall.  It does not show flooding that occurs from overflowing watercourses, drainage systems or public sewers caused by catchment-wide rainfall events or river flow.  A national model has been run for 1 in 30, 1 in 100 and 1 in 1000 year rainfall events.  It has been modelled on a 2 metre square grid.  Lead Local Flood Authorities were consulted and where available locally held model outputs have been incorporated into the maps.\nThis dataset has been superseded by the new National Flood Hazard Maps 2019 - NRW_DS124790\n    ",
