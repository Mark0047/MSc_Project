        "notes": "There are a total of 5 Health and Social Care Trusts (HSCT) in Northern Ireland; Belfast, Northern, Southern, South Eastern and Western. Each HSCT is managed directly by a board of directors which has corporate responsibility for its operation. The trusts are responsible for the delivery of responsive and effective health and care services and for the ownership and management of hospitals and other establishments and facilities. This health trust boundary dataset is derived from Ordnance Survey Northern Ireland (OSNI) 1993 local government district boundary dataset.\r\n\r\nA review of the original DHSSPS Trust Boundary dataset was completed in 2017. The original DHSSPS/DoH Trust Boundaries were derived from Land and Property Services (LPS) 50K scale Local Government Districts 1993. Using a scale of 1:50K to create the boundaries led to Largescale variations being made visible. This final DoH Trust Boundary shapefile is derived from LPS' 1993 Largescale Local Government Districts, removing scale variations and other surplus attribute information from the previous version.

Digital NI aims to help establish a culture within Northern Ireland that develops and enhances Digital capability not just through interactions with Government, but also with local companies and throughout communities. Within government the Digital Transformation Service is facilitating this cultural shift through a number of methods, transforming Government services, making data open and available and encouraging and coaching those who lack digital skills.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that opening up our data is the right thing to do in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the Public Sector in Northern Ireland. It has the potential to encourage new commercial opportunities and drive economic growth and innovation across public and private sectors.",
