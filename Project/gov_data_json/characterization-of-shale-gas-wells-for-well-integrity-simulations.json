        "notes": "The dataset is on characterization of shale gas wells for well integrity simulations. Basing on raw data and other information pertaining to two shale gas wells, acquired from Polish Oil and Gas Company (PGNiG) input to the well integrity simulations carried out by TNO was supplied by PIG-PIB. The input consisted in elaborating generalized models of the wells and their surroundings as wells as characterization of the target formations. Well construction schemes including the production casing sizes and depths and generalized lithostratigraphy of the geological formations in question were composed. Raw data acquired from PGNiG included wireline logging data (and interpretation results) together with results of laboratory measurements of drill core samples (e.g., on geomechanical properties). Regarding characterization of the target formations the most important information created were distributions of in situ stresses within particular formations in both wells, assessed on the base of results of wireline, density logging (vertical stress \u2013 based on weight of the overburden at a certain depth) and laboratory measurements of geomechanical parameters (horizontal stress \u2013 based on pressure values measured within rock sample in tri-axial chamber at reservoir conditions). Temperature values within formations in question were assessed assuming local geothermal gradient and information from PGNiG reports. The dataset was created within SECURe project (Subsurface Evaluation of CCS and Unconventional Risks) - https://www.securegeoenergy.eu/. This project has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 764531",
