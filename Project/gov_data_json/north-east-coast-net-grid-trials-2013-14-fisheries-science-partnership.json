        "notes": "The twin rig trawler Aquarius II was chartered for ten days in September and \nOctober 2013 to undertake fishing trials in the Nephrops (*Nephrops \nnorvegicus*) fishery off the North east coast of England. The aim of the work \nwas to significantly reduce cod catches in this fishery through collective \naction with local fishing skippers. The practical approach taken was to insert \na design concept under development known as the Net Grid into a trawl and to \nevidence changes in selectivity towards cod and other commercial species under \nnormal fishing conditions. The objective of the work was to further develop \nthis design with the aim of developing a trawl that reduces catches of cod in \nthe English NE Nephrops trawl fishery without losing the target species of \n*Nephrops*.",
