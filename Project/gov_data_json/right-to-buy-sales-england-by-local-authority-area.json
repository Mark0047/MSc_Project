        "notes": "These statistics relate only to sales by local authorities under the Right to Buy scheme and exclude sales by Private Registered Providers (PRPs) under preserved Right to Buy. Sales by PRPs are recorded in Social Housing Sales\n\nThe sales figures exclude Right to Buy sales of dwellings which are not accounted for in a local authority\u2019s Housing Revenue Account, either because the authority, having disposed of nearly all its dwellings to a registered provider, has closed down its Housing Revenue Account or because the dwelling was originally tied to a particular occupation (e.g. a school caretaker\u2019s cottage or a park keeper\u2019s cottage).\r\n\r\nThe figures also exclude any Right to Buy sales of dwellings which, although accounted for in the Housing Revenue Account, are the subject of an agreement made either under section 80B of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 (as inserted by section 313 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 and now repealed) or under section 11(6) of the Local Government Act 2003 (as inserted by section 174 of the Localism Act 2011). \r\n\r\nThe figures include sales at less than market value of dwellings accounted for in the Housing Revenue Account to secure tenants of a local authority, even when those sales are not under Right to Buy.\r\n\r\nSome figures will include proportions of dwellings. This is because the figures also include sales of a shared ownership lease of a dwelling accounted for in the Housing Revenue Account where either the premium (i.e. a portion of the market value of the dwelling) paid by the purchaser exceeded 50% of the market value of the dwelling or the sum of the premium paid by the purchaser and all other premiums paid up to two years before the payment of the current premium. Where a shared ownership disposal has been included, the figure corresponds to the portion of the market value paid; for example the purchase of a 50% equity share will be represented by 0.5.\r\n\r\nFor detailed definitions, see definitions in Right to Buy Statistics.\r\n\r\nData are collected from a quarterly local authority return to the DCLG called LOGASNet. Local authorities with dwelling stock which receive poolable housing receipts supply these data to DCLG on a quarterly basis.\r\n\r\nThese data are taken directly from the Social Housing Sales data set, [Live Table 691](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-social-housing-sales)\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that figures published in the live tables are organised into financial quarters, i.e. 2013/2014 financial Q1 corresponds to April-June 2013, whereas figures are published here in calendar quarter intervals, where 2013 calendar Q1 corresponds to the interval Jan \u2013 March 2013. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf data is not provided for a local authority this is either due to the authority not owning dwelling stock, or the reporting boundaries changing and thereby causing groups of authorities in the affected areas to be reclassified and consequently not reporting data for specific time periods.     \r\n\r\n\r\n",
