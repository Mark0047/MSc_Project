Reviews undertaken by the Food and Environment Research Agency (FERA) in 2011 identified significant potential impacts of Phytophthora, and of measures to control Phytophthora, on heathland biodiversity .\n1.2.\tSince the first UK findings in 2002 there has been a coordinated approach to disease control aimed at containment and eradication of these pathogens whilst evidence was gathered to make a decision on future policy. During that time the diseases have continued to spread, albeit slowly and mainly in the South West. Following a review of the historic and current situation, available scientific and economic evidence, and public consultation on options for management of the pathogens in the future, Ministers concluded that more needs to be done to contain and eradicate P. ramorum and P. kernoviae.\n1.3.\tIn April 2009 Defra launched a five year programme, managed by Fera, to contain the risk of P. ramorum and P. kernoviae from spreading further. The three main work streams of the programme are research and development, education and awareness raising, and disease control through clearance of host plants in high risk areas. This involves removal of infected sporulating hosts in woodlands and the wider environment, and proactive clearance of uninfected areas to protect high risk sites; combined with enhanced containment and eradication measures in infected gardens and nursery sites, as well as the identification and control of any new outbreaks.\n1.4.\tCurrently there are 10 heathland sites where Vaccinium is infected with Phytophthora \u2013 9 Phytophthora kernoviae (Pk) and 1 Phytophthora ramorum (Pr). There are other Pr/Pk outbreaks on non-heathland sites, e.g. woodland sites and parks. There have also been increasing numbers of findings of P. pseudosyringae on Vaccinium.\n1.5.\tFera are undertaking research on efficacy of different control treatments \u2013 they will be treating these 10 currently infected sites in the Autumn of 2011. FERA are returning to treated sites to check if the disease is still present, and have been doing some recording of the cover of Vaccinium in quadrats, but no other recording of effects on biodiversity. \n1.6.\tThis project will build on previous and ongoing work by Fera to determine effective control strategies for Phytophthora on heathland and other semi-natural habitats containing Vaccinium. It will focus, in particular on the potential impacts of control measures on heathland biodiversity, but will integrate further consideration of the effectiveness of treatments and develop guidance for conservation managers on identification, management and mitigation for Phytophthora on heathland and other semi-natural habitats.",
