        "notes": "This dataset is a subset of \"WFD Classification Status Cycle 2\" and contains classification data for phytoplankton in coastal water bodies.  Phytoplankton are microscopic primary producers and form the basis of the food chain. They utilise sunlight energy and dissolved nutrients converting these into organic materials which are often consumed by higher life forms such as fish. As phytoplankton are short lived and derive their nutrients from the water; they are an ideal indicator of changing nutrient conditions and therefore useful for assessing pollution of coastal waters\n\n In natural waters a high number of different species of phytoplankton would be expected with high levels of growth in the spring and autumn (blooms). There would be a natural population decline due to nutrient depletion and grazing pressures in the summer. Phtyoplankton population data, group succession and chlorophyll data are used in combination to produce scores known as Ecological Quality Ratios (EQR). EQRs are used to produce a Phytoplankton classification (High, Good, Moderate, Poor, Bad) of the water body for Water Framework Directive (WFD) purposes.
