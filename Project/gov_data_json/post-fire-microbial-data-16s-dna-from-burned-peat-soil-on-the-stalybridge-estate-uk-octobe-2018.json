        "notes": "This dataset contains information on the Bacterial Amplicon Sequence Variant (ASV) abundance from peat soil sampled following a wildfire on the Stalybridge estate (UK) in June 2020. Samples were taken in 10 established plots at three time periods following the fire: approximately 3 months, 10 months and 12 months post-fire. This was taken at two depths: 0 \u2013 5cm from the surface (top) and 5 \u2013 10 cm from the surface (bottom). The 10 plots were divided into two groups of five, one that was observed to have suffered a light burn (termed shallow burn) and one that received a more severe burn (termed deep burn). Five additional plots were sampled at the same time as the 3-month samples from a neighbouring unburned site (termed control plots). Samples where no ASVs were observed were removed from the dataset. Full details about this dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5285/01ced3c2-17c6-4512-b73b-e065afed7bad",
