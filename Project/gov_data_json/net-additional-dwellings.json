If no data was submitted, the observation is marked as 'missing'.  In cases where changes in geography mean that a combination of year and local authority district is not applicable, the observation has been omitted from the dataset.\r\n\r\nNet additions measure the absolute increase in stock between one year and the next, including other losses and gains (such as conversions, changes of use and demolitions).\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nSources\t\r\nHousing Flows Reconciliation (HFR), the Greater London Authority and Regional Assembly joint returns.  From 2000-01 to 2003-04, all local authorities submitted data to CLG through the Housing Flows Reconcilation (HFR) form. Following the abolition of the Regional Planning Bodies in 2010, Local authorities in all regions except London have returned to submitting data via the HFR from 2009-10.  \r\n\t\t\r\nData for London are supplied by the GLA.\t\t\r\n\r\nBetween 2004-05 and 2008-09 CLG worked jointly with Regional Planning bodies in the south and midlands on joint data returns in an attempt to ensure consistency between the net housing supply figures reported in regional Annual Monitoring Reports (AMRs) and those published by central government.\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nNew Geographies\t\t\r\nOn 1st April 2009 nine new unitary authorities (UAs) were formed from the combination of 37 former district councils. \t\t\r\nFigures are no longer collected on the previous geographic basis. \t\t\r\nCheshire West UA from Chester, Ellesmere Port & Neston and Vale Royal; . \t\t\r\nCheshire East UA was formed from Congleton, Crewe & Nantwich and Macclesfield; \t\t\r\nBedford UA from Bedford; and Central Bedfordshire UA from Mid Bedfordshire and South Bedfordshire\t\t\r\nThe remaining five new UAs were each formed from all former districts of the county concerned.\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n Latest update \t\t02/11/2011\r\n Next update \t\tOct-2012",
