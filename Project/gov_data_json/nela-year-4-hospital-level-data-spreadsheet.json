The name of the variable in Year 3 \"Proportion of included cases where neither time of decision to operate nor time of booking for theatre was submitted\" has therefore been renamed in Year 4 to \"Proportion of included cases where no time of decision to operate for theatre was submitted\".  Additionally the variable \"Proportion of cases where interval from decision to operate (or time of booking) to arrival in theatre was appropriate to documented operative urgency (for cases with urgency <18 hours)\" has been renamed in Year 4 to \"Proportion of cases where interval from decision to operate to arrival in theatre was appropriate to documented operative urgency (for cases with urgency <18 hours)\"",
