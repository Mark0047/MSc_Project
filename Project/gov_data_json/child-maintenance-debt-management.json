This can be relating to a legal action taken against a Person or External Organisation, the goal of which is not directly the recovery of debt but punishment for non-compliance or illegal behaviour (e.g. fraud, violence). Enforcement Actions  - where a debt exists in a child maintenance case and action is required to recover that debt by gaining possession or realising the value of a debtor's asset(s). For example databases contain information about: data includes: personal and financial details, assets,  organisation/employer details, debt period, type of action taken, information relating to an instance of a communication activity between the Child Maintenance Group and a person or external organisation e.g. letters, telephone calls, meetings, details of any evidence. These systems are used in GB and Northern Ireland.",
