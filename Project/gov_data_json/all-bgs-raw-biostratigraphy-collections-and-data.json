        "notes": "A comprehensive collection of British fossil specimens and records compiled over 150 years of palaeontological collecting and research. Also includes all associated paper data, registers, indexes of locality and storage and reports of conclusions. The specimens have variable scattered coverage mostly within the UK and Ireland but there are some overseas data. Some specimens are sited accurately to less than 1 metre, whilst some specimens have accuracies of several kilometres. Includes both locality based biostratigraphic material, plus significant type, figured and cited samples of taxonomic importance. Specimens collected by Survey geologists throughout history of Survey, with some donated specimens (e.g. the Geological Society of London Collection) predating 1835, material is still being added. The collection includes hand specimens, casts & moulds, microfossil slides & cut sections and also registers containing identifications and locality information. The specimens have various uses within biostratigraphy and taxonomy. The data have key attribute data such as locality, stratigraphic age, matrix lithology, taxonomy, etc that could be used for linking in other datasets. Access and use of the data is subject to current policies, inline with MDA's (Museum Documentation Association) Spectrum guidelines and MLA's (Museum Libraries Archives Council) Accreditation guidelines. The collection can be viewed by loan or visit, whilst copies of the associated paper data can be made available as photocopy, scan, spreadsheet, etc., subject to certain constraints and conditions.",
