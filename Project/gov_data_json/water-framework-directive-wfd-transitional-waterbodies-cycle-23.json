        "notes": "      'Water Framework Directive (WFD) Transitional Waterbodies' is a polygon Shapefile dataset containing attributes that have been collated as defined for the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). Article 2, clause 6 of the WFD defines them as '...bodies of surface water in the vicinity of river mouths which are partly saline in character as a result of their proximity to coastal waters but are substantially influenced by freshwater flows'. Transitional waterbodies were defined from Mean High Water boundaries, taken directly from OS 1:50K MeridianTM 2, and NRW estuarine boundaries defined for the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (UWWTD). Since waterbodies are attributed with a unique identifier 'EA_WB_ID' this dataset can be linked dire\r\nctly to other WFD data sources such as physical characteristics, risk, classification and proposed objectives. These data apply to Cycle 2 of the Water Framework Directive.\r\n\r\n    ",
