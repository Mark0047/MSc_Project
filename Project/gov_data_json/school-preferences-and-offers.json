The data are collected on national offer day - 1st March or the next working day - relating to applications for entry into the next academic year.  \n\nNote this dataset is currently only collected at secondary level. In 2014, however, there will be the first national offer day for entry into primary school 16 April 2014 and the intention is to gather data at primary level as well. The regulations to allow this are currently 21 August 2013 in the final stages of drafting before being laid before parliament. ",
