The authority decides what measures can be taken to achieve these purposes, which are:\r\n\r\nTo conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks and\r\nTo promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the Parks by the public\r\n",
