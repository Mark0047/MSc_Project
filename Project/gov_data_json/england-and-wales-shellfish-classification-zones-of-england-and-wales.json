        "notes": "Map of Bivalve mollusc (shellfish) classification zones. Available on Magic, \nSpire and Cefas website.\n\nBivalve mollusc (shellfish) harvesting areas are classified according to the \nextent of contamination shown by monitoring of *E. coli* in shellfish \nflesh. Treatment processes are stipulated according to the classification \nstatus of the area.\n\nThe classification categories are:\n\n**Class A** (80% of samples must be \u2264 230 *E. coli*/100g; all samples must \nbe less than 700 E. coli/100g) - molluscs can be harvested for direct human \nconsumption\n\n**Class B** (90% of samples must be \u2264 4600 *E. coli*/100g; all samples \nmust be less than 46000 E. coli/100g) - molluscs can be sold for human \nconsumption:\n\n\n-   after purification in an approved plant, or\n-   after re-laying in an approved Class A re-laying area, or\n-   after an EC-approved heat treatment process.\n\n**Class C** (\u2264 46000 *E. coli*/100g) - molluscs can be sold for human \nconsumption only after re-laying for at least two months in an approved \nre-laying area followed, where necessary, by treatment in a purification \ncentre, or after an EC-approved heat treatment process.\n\nIn all cases, the health standards in Annex III of EC Regulations 853/2004 and \nthe microbiological criteria adopted under EC Regulation 2073/2005 must be \nmet. Molluscs must not be subject to production or collected in prohibited \nareas.\n\nThere are two classification systems in England and Wales:\n\n\n(  1.)the annual or \"temporary\" classification system\n(  2.)the long-term classification (LTC) system.\n\nNew areas are initially given annual/temporary classifications until they meet \nthe criteria for an LTC. Harvesting sites that do not meet LTC criteria are \nautomatically classified under the annual/temporary classification system.\n\nClassification: Class A=1, Class B=2, Class C=3, Prohibited=4, Long Term Class \nB=5, Seasonal Class B/Class C=6, Seasonal ClassA/Class B=7",
