Between 1961 and 2015, a total of 22,573 cod were tagged \nand released using either conventional marker-ID tags and in the more recent \nyears of the dataset, electronic data storage tags (DSTs), of which 6,703 tags \nwere subsequently returned. For tagged fish that were recaptured as much \ninformation as possible was recorded, namely the recapture date and location, \nlength, weight, sex and maturity. Otoliths (ear stones) were removed for age \ndetermination purposes and other studies. These data are used to provide \ninformation for studies relating to fish behaviour, growth and identification \nof stock units.",
