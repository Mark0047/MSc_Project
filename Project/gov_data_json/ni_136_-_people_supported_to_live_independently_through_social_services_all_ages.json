The indicator will be age standardised and, if possible, adjusted for likely needs for social care services using needs-weighted population data produced from Relative Needs Formula (RNF) allocation calculations. Issues remain on potential double counting between assessed services and grant funded services and within grant funded services that need to be resolved.\r\nSource: Referrals, Assessment and Packages of Care Data (RAP) & Grant Funded Services (GFS1) data\r\nPublisher: DCLG Floor Targets Interactive\r\nGeographies: Local Authority District (LAD), County/Unitary Authority, Government Office Region (GOR), National\r\nGeographic coverage: England\r\nTime coverage: 2004/05, 2008/09\r\nType of data: Administrative data",
