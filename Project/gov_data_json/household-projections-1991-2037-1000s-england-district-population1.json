        "notes": "This data contains household 2012 based population projections by district.\n\nThe methodology for the 2012-based household projections was based upon the \u20182011-based interim\u2019 and \u20182008-based\u2019 household projections.  A description is provided in the Methodology Document.  The methodology uses the latest ONS sub-national population projections and incorporates information from the Census 2011 on household population and numbers down to local authority level and some data on household formation rates at a national level. Further work will investigate including detailed analysis of household formation down to local authority level. In the meantime, these projections provide the most up to date and nationally consistent estimates.    \r\n \r\nAs with the previous projections, the methodology is split into two stages: Stage One produces summary household numbers based on long-term demographic trends and Stage Two gives a more detailed breakdown of household type. This release presents results from Stage One only, with Stage Two outputs to follow as soon as possible.  \r\n \r\nThe assumptions underlying national household and population projections are based on demographic trends. They are not forecasts as, for example, they do not attempt to predict the impact of future Government policies, changing economic circumstances or other factors that might have influence household growth. The projections show the household numbers that would result if the assumptions based in previous demographic trends in the population and rates of household formation were to be realised in practice. \r\n\r\nThis data was derived from  published live tables available for download as an [Excel spreadsheet](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/407641/Household_Projections_Published_Tables.ods).\r\n",
