        "notes": "This Gardline marine geophysical survey took place during May/June 2005 in the Eastern English Channel aboard the MV Tridens. This survey was undertaken for the Eastern English Channel Marine Habitat Map study (EECMHM) as part of a series of four surveys. The EECMHM study was funded by the Marine Environment Protection Fund (MEPF) a marine component of the Aggregate Levy Sustainability Fund (MALSF). Sea floor data collected were high-resolution multibeam bathymetry, echosounder and side-scan sonar. Subsurface data were gathered using a Surface Tow Boomer. Most of the data were recorded digitally. Some paper records were also generated also. These data are archived with the MEDIN Data Archive Centres (DACs), including the BGS DAC for geology and geophysics and the UKHO DAC for bathymetry data. For further information on the surveys and general information on the EECMHM see the final report (James et al, 2007. Cefas Science Series Technical Report No. 139).",
