Caribe Tide. The survey was carried out as part of a regional mapping programme. Data were gathered using the following equipment Navigation: SAT/NAV; Subsurface data were gathered using a gas/airgun (sleeve exploder), 640 km were covered in a grid of 14 lines. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in an Acquisition Report (SO/90/029). Seismic Interpretation Training Package, IGS reports 74/12; 75/11 and BGS Techincal Report WB/92/37 includes data from this survey.",
