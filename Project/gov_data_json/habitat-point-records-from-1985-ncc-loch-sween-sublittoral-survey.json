        "notes": "Loch Sween, in the Sound of Jura, south-west Scotland, has been selected as a proposed Marine Nature Reserve by the NCC. A considerable body of information exists on the sublittoral habitats of the Loch Sween system. NCC has contributed to this by extensive and intensive sublittoral surveys of the loch (Earll, 1982; Lumb, 1986). Sublittoral studies have generally concentrated on the 'arms' of Loch Sween and on the sill systems present, areas of particularly high scientific interest. There is a requirement for additional information on the sublittoral habitats and communities within the main body of the loch and in the approaches to Loch Sween. This is necessary for further assessment of the scientific interest and conservation importance of these areas, to assist selection of the PMNR boundaries and to provide information on management requirements. This report contains the results of sublittoral survey work carried out in 1985 using a mixture of diving and remote-sampling techniques. The habitats and communities recorded within the area are described. The results of previous year's surveys have not been incorporated into this report, nor is a detailed assessment of the scientific interest and conservation importance made. Several communities were recorded for the first time during this survey. The majority were found in the approaches to Loch Sween. There is now a relatively comprehensive coverage of the Loch Sween area. Some additional work may be required and this is indicated in the report. Records currently considered sensitive have been removed from this dataset.",
