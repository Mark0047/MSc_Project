        "notes": "Fire-related casualties per 100,000 population\n\n#### How the figure is calculated:\r\n\r\nNumber of fire-related casualties in England in the reporting period divided by latest ONS mid-year population estimate, multiplied by 100,000. Quarterly population estimates use average quarterly growth rates.\r\n\r\n#### Why is this indicator in the business plan?\r\n\r\nChange in the number of fire-related casualties demonstrates the net effect of activity relating to fire safety and of other factors affecting the incidence and seriousness of fires in terms of casualties.\r\n\r\n#### How often is it updated?\r\n\r\nEvery six months: April to September data are first published each January, and October to March data are first published each July.\r\n\r\n#### Where does the data come from?\r\n\r\nFire and Rescue Incident Recording System. Published figures are available  [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government/series/fire-statistics-monitor).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What area does the headline figure cover?\r\n\r\nEngland\r\n\r\n#### Are further breakdowns of the data available?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### What does a change in this indicator show?\r\n\r\nA sustained change in this indicator would show that on average across the country fire safety outcomes had changed. A reduction in this indicator would be an improvement as it would reflect a lower level of fire related casualties.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Time Lag\r\n\r\nPublished within three to four months of the end of the reporting period.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Next available update\r\n\r\nTBC.\r\n\r\n#### Type of Data\r\n\r\nNational Statistics.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Robustness and data limitations\r\n\r\nThe data are fit for purpose. Fire and Rescue Authorities record details of incidents attended routinely and subject to national standards and guidelines.\r\nFire casualties data are seasonal with slightly higher totals typically in winter months compared to summer months. As a result latest data are compared to\r\nthe same period 12 months earlier.\r\n\r\n#### Links to Further Information\r\n\r\n[https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government/series/fire-statistics-monitor](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government/series/fire-statistics-monitor)\r\n\r\n#### Contact Details\r\n\r\n[CorporatePerformance@communities.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:CorporatePerformance@communities.gsi.gov.uk)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
