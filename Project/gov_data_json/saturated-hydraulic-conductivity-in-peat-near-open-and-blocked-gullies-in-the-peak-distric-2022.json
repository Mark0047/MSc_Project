        "notes": "This dataset provides saturated hydraulic conductivity values which were obtained from samples of peat. The peat was collected adjacent to erosion gullies that were either open, or adjacent to dams on gullies which had been installed as part of peatland restoration. The sites studied were Kinder Scout and Withens Clough in the Peak District, northern England. Values of saturated hydraulic conductivity were obtained from replicate samples. At each sampling location values were obtained for 5 cm long peat samples across three depth ranges (0-10 cm, 35-45 cm, 75-85 cm), and three distances from gully edges (0 cm, 100 cm, 500 cm). Comparisons were made between peat next to blocked gully dams and peat not adjacent to a gully dam and between the two peatland sites. The work was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council (Grant NE/R004595/1). Full details about this dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5285/0567ac9f-3e35-4f41-9efa-8e97948401f8",
