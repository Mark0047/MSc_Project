        "notes": "This dataset lists conservation measures that were taken (i.e. which are already being implemented) for the species during the 2008-2012 reporting period. This information formed part of the Tenth UK Report for Article 12 of the EU Birds Directive (2008-2012).  This  applies only to those species on the checklist of SPA trigger species.\n\nThe main purpose of the reporting under this field is to obtain information to allow for a \u00e2\u0080\u0098broad-brush\u00e2\u0080\u0099 but informative overview of the measures taken inside and outside the Natura 2000 network, and with reference to importance and effectiveness. The current format and codified list of conservation measures (to be found in the Reference Portal, http://bd.eionet.europa.eu/activities/Reporting/Article_12/reference_portal.  Appendix 1) aims to facilitate reporting in a more harmonised way and to promote further use of the data reported, namely as part of the process to evaluate the contribution of the SPA network to maintaining or improving the condition of bird species.\n\nThe dataset on measures includes the \n*type of measure using the following categories. a) Legal/statutory b) Administrative c) Contractual d) Recurrent e) One-off\n*ranking of the importance of the measure (high medium or low)\n*location of the measure (inside or outside the SPA network)\n*effectiveness of the measure \n\nThe following categorisation of UK activities was developed for guidance with respect to the conservation measure \u00e2\u0080\u0098type\u00e2\u0080\u0099 field.\n*Legal/statutory: Existing and proposed (if underway) legally protected areas; legally protected species; abstraction licences; discharge consents\n*Administrative: Water Level Management Plans; NNR management plans; Catchment Sensitive Farming (where no specific project with a landowner); Species Recovery Projects (where no specific contract with third party)\n*Contractual: Agri-environment: (O)ELS, (O)HLS, classic schemes; Conservation and Enhancement Scheme (CES); Catchment Sensitive Farming (where a specific agreed project with landowner; Species Recovery Project (where a specific contract/agreement with third party)\n*Recurrent: Needing to be repeatedly implemented during reporting cycle e.g. habitat management activity\n* ne-off: Implemented once during reporting cycle e.g. Capital Works projects; Infrastructure; agri-environment HLS special projects linked to specific positive outcomes for the species",
