As the estimates are model-based they are different to standard direct estimates obtained from surveys and from statistics provided by administrative sources.  The model-based methodology has been developed to ensure that the ward estimates are constrained to the published Family Resources Survey (FRS) direct Government Office Region (GOR) estimates for England and the direct estimate for the country of Wales. For example, the model-based estimates for the wards in Wales aggregate to the FRS estimate of average weekly household income for Wales. However, the model-based estimates will not be consistent with FRS estimates of average weekly household income for other geographical levels.",
