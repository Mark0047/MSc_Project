        "notes": "The Digital Public Rights of Way (PROW) layer shows registered rights of way managed by the Lake District National Park Authority.\r\n\r\nThis layer details the positions of rights of way recorded on the Definitive Map of Public Rights of Way for Cumbria that fall within the National Park. There are over 3,200 miles of public rights of way in the Lake District. They are a great resource to help you exercise, relax or enjoy the outstanding quality of the Lakeland countryside, towns and villages. The data contains routes which can be used by walkers (public footpaths, bridleways and byways) and horse riders and cyclists (public bridleways and byways). You can use the data to plan your countryside visit, discover information about public rights of way in your locality and report problems with the rights of way network to the National Park Authority.\r\n\r\nThe rights of way information shown in this layer are provided for information only and must not be relied on for legal, statutory or any other formal purposes. The data was originally derived from the paper sources that comprise the Definitive Map and Statement for Cumbria. If a way is not registered on the Definitive Map, it does not prove that public rights do not exist. The legal record of rights of way, known as the Definitive Map and Statement, can be viewed by appointment with the Rights of Way Mapping section at Cumberland Council Council or Westmorland and Furness Council. In addition, the digital data is also being checked to ensure its accuracy, leading to continuous amendments being made.\r\n\r\nThe Lake District National Park Authority is not responsible for Rights of Way within the towns of Bowness, Keswick or Ambleside; and as such these areas are not published in this dataset. Westmorland and Furness Council currently owns and manages the the routes in Bowness and Ambleside, and Cumberland Council manages the routes in Keswick.",
