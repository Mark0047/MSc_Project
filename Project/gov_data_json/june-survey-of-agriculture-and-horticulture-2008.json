        "notes": "The June survey of Agriculture and Horticulture is an annual survey which collects detailed information on arable and horticultural cropping activities, land usage, livestock populations and labour force figures. This is a compulsory survey conducted under EU legislation and helps provide hard evidence on the condition of the agricultural industry. The survey data has many uses, from assisting with animal disease control processes to providing information which is used for management of the EU cereals markets. It is also used heavily by environmental policy makers who assess the impact of CAP reform on the agricultural industry and the landscape.  As it is such a large survey, the data can be used to provide low level statistics i.e. at county level, which makes it a powerful tool for researchers and anyone interested in local features.\r\nThere is a SPARQL Endpoint where this data can be queried and retrieved in RDF, XML or JSON at http://services.data.gov.uk/environment/sparql\r\n\r\nIf you require the datasets in a more accessible format, please contact farming-statistics@defra.gsi.gov.uk ",
