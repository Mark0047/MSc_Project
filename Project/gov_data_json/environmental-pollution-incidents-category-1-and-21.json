Details of environmental incidents within the remit of the Environment Agency are held on the National Incident Recording System (NIRS2).  This dataset only includes substantiated completed and closed Environment Management incidents (predominantly pollution), where the environment impact level is either category 1 (major) or category 2 (significant) to at least 1 media (i.e. water, land or air). It is updated quarterly and provides a snapshot of data held in NIRS2.  There is an inherent lag time in investigating and recording the necessary incident details to complete a record and recent incidents may not appear.  The data may also be subject to change due to final QA and as further information becomes available.\nINFORMATION WARNING:\nWhere these data indicate an incident occurred on a particular site or property no inference should be drawn that the site or property owner necessarily was responsible.
