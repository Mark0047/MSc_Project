Sea floor data were collected using an echosounder and a transit sonar. Subsurface data were gathered using a pinger a total of 440 miles were covered. Seabed samples and cores were collected using Shipek grab, Gravity corer (sediment & rock), Vibrocorer, and wireline drilling. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS Internal Report WB/72/2.",
