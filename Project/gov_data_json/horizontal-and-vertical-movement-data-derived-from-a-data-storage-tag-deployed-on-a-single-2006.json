The cod was tagged in the \nSouthern North Sea on 25/03/2005 and was recaptured in the Eastern English \nChannel on the 09/01/2006. The cod migrates down through the English Channel, \nresides in the Celtic Sea and then returns. The dataset contains 291 days of \ninformation. Each day consists of 144 vertical movement rates (in metres), one \nhorizontal movement rate (in kilometres) and one turning angle (in radians, \nfrom -pi to pi). Vertical movement rates have been log (natural log) \ntransformed.",
