        "notes": "The king scallop Pecten maximus L. is the fastest growing fishery in the UK \nand currently the second most valuable. Mass mortality events in scallops have \nbeen reported associated with rickettsia-like organisms (RLOs) world-wide, \nhowever the causative agents were uncharacterised. In May 2013 and 2014 two \nmass mortality events affecting king scallops were recorded in the Lyme Bay \nMarine Protected Area (MPA) South West England. Histopathological examination \nshowed gill epithelial tissue infected with RLO at varying intensity. \nUltrastructural examination confirmed the intracellular location in affected \nepithelial cells. Partial 16S rDNA sequences of a putative RLO obtained from \ninfected king scallop gill samples collected from both mortality events were \nidentical and had 99.4% identity to 16S rDNA sequences obtained from \nCandidatus endonucleobacter bathymodioli and 95% with Endozoicomonas spp. In \nsitu hybridisation assays using 16S rDNA probes confirmed the presence of the \nsequenced RLO gene in the gill tissues. Additional DNA sequences of the \nbacterium were obtained using high-throughput (Illumina) sequencing and \nbioinformatic analysis identified over 1000 genes with high similarity, \nranging from 77-87% identity, to genes from Endozoicomonas spp.",
