This data is divided into multiple four letter coded sections which refer to a specific locality and/or experiment type. BORD are alternating field demagnetisation results on volcanic material from the Scottish Borders, 330 million years old, sampled in the summer of 2017, carried out by Dr Courtney Sprain. BORR are thermal demagnetisation results on volcanic material from Burnmouth Harbour, Longhoughton Beach, Pease Bay, Joppa Shore, Sugar Sands Bay and Ross Beach in the Scottish Borders, 330 million years old, sampled in the summer of 2017, carried out by Dr Courtney Sprain. CMBR are thermal demagnetisation results on rock material from around Cumbria, 330 million years old, and sampled in Spring 2017, sampled and carried out by Dr Courtney Sprain and Dr Mark Hounslow. CUMB are alternating field demagnetisation results on rock material from around Cumbria, 330 million years old, and sampled in spring 2017, sampled and carried out by Dr Courtney Sprain and Dr Mark Hounslow.",
