        "notes": "This record holds data from 2015 to 2022.  Previous years data is available on request.\n\nWe use compliance ratings to help assess the risks from a regulated facility. \n\nAn operator\u2019s compliance record will affect whether they pay a subsistence charge that is higher or lower than the base charge. We will calculate a compliance rating for an operator based on their compliance record.\nWe calculate a compliance rating after a permit has been issued and use a standard approach called the Compliance Classification Scheme to classify permit breaches.\nA compliance rating only applies to a permit for a waste operation or installation.\nIt does not apply to farming installations operated by members of the our Pig and Poultry Assurance Scheme, or waste mobile plant.\n\nWe identify and record any non-compliances in the course of a calendar year \u2013 January to December. We use this information to work out a compliance rating based on a points system. For permits that cover more than one activity, the compliance rating will apply to the whole permit.\nWe convert permit breaches into a points system. We add the points from each breach to calculate an annual total of non-compliance points.\nWe allocate points based on the amount of extra work we usually have to do when dealing with different types of permit breaches.\n\nCCS Category breach 1 (most serious)\t60 points\nCCS Category breach 2 (serious)\t\t31 points\nCCS Category breach 3 (less serious)\t  4 points\nCCS Category breach 4 (minor)\t\t0.1 points\n\nBased on the cumulative score over a calendar year, we place each site into one of six compliance bands A to F.\nBand A\t\t0 points\t\t        Discount of 5% on subsistence charge\nBand B\t\t0.1-10 points\t\tNo impact on subsistence charge\nBand C\t\t10.1-30 points\t\t10% increase on subsistence charge\nBand D\t\t30.1-60 points\t\t25% increase on subsistence charge\nBand E\t\t60.1-149.9 points\t50% increase on subsistence charge\nBand F\t\t150+ points\t\t200% increase on subsistence charge\n\nCHANGES TO THIS DATASET\nThis dataset was previously provided in the Opra record.  The Opra scheme has now been replaced by a new charging scheme. Attribution statement: \u00a9 Environment Agency copyright and/or database right 2024. All rights reserved.",
