Values are given in millions of pounds and are seasonally adjusted. \n\nOutput is defined as the amount charged by construction companies to customers for the value of work (produced during the reporting period) excluding VAT and payments to sub-contractors.\r\n\r\nConstruction output estimates are a short-term indicator of construction output by the private sector and public corporations within Great Britain and are produced from a monthly survey of 8,000 businesses in Great Britain. The estimates are produced and published at current prices (including inflationary price effects) and at chained volume estimates (with inflationary effects removed) both seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted. Chained volume measures are also described as volume. Construction output is used in the compilation of the output approach to measuring gross domestic product (GDP).\r\n\r\nThe most recent ONS data release from which this data is sourced can be found [here](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/construction/output-in-the-construction-industry/november-2015/index.html).\r\n",
