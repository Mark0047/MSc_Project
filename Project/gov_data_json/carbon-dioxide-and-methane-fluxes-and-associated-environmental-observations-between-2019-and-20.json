        "notes": "This dataset contains time series observations of land surface-atmosphere exchanges of net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange (NEE), sensible heat (H) and latent heat (LE), methane (CH4) and meteorological observations measured at two locations in the Flow Country blanket bog complex, Caithness and Sutherland, UK. The tower over the area affected by wildfire after initial felling (UK-DKF) is located at 58.431, -3.96 and monitors across a footprint affected by a wildfire in early May 2019. The tower over the area felled for restoration after previous afforestation (UK-DKE-RESTORED, which was not affected by the wildfire) is located at 58.428, -3.967 and measures fluxes from a footprint identical in ground flora, topography, soil type and previous management to that of the FIRE tower, with the only exception that the fire did not reach as far as the footprint monitored. The dataset comprises eddy covariance CO2, water and energy fluxes, originally collected at 20Hz and processed to 30-minute data, as well as accompanying meteorological observations, originally collected at 15 min and processed to 30-minute data. The time period covered in this dataset is 25/09/2019 \u2013 20/05/2021. Full details about this dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5285/d4a7ca90-0c62-4a31-986e-f433e1644bf3",
