Seabed sampling data was collected using gravity corer, day grab, box corer and megacorer. A British Geological Survey geologist was onboard to undertake geological descriptions, the data from which is archived at BGS. For any other data from this survey contact National Oceanography Centre. Technical details of the survey are contained in SOC Cruise Report 25.",
