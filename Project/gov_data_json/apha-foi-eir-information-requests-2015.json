The dataset includes the following fields: Reference number (a unique identifier for each request); Status (whether the case is Open or Closed, etc.); Date fields (for receipt, response, etc.); Deadlines (whether the legislative deadlines were met); Details of Request (a brief summary of each query); Format (whether the request was received via email, letter, etc.); Regulations (which legislation the request was handled under); Category (a general grouping of requests by subject area or type); Outcome (whether the information was released or not); Exemptions (detailing any legal exemptions applied); Internal Review fields (details of cases where an Internal Review was requested); ICO fields (for cases where the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) were involved).  \r\n\r\nPlease note: this dataset does not include any data requests handled under Data Protection legislation.  The case referencing used by APHA is a consecutive numbering system, therefore any gaps in the sequence are the result of Data Protection cases being removed.  \r\n\r\nPlease note: the data for this dataset was captured on 26/02/2016.
