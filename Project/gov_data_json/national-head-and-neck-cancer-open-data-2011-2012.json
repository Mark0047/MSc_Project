The data are also being made available on the data.gov website. \r\n\r\nWhat information is being made available? \r\n\r\nAudit participation by NHS Trust and data completeness for the key fields. \r\n\r\nMeasures of aspects of the care given to patients. \r\n\r\nInformation about care outcomes and treatment. \r\n\r\nTrusts and Networks are identified by name and their national code. These data do not list individual patient information, nor do they contain any patient identifiable data. \r\n\r\nThe National Head and Neck Cancer Audit focuses on cancer sites within the head and neck (excluding tumours of the brain and thyroid cancers). The most common of which are the larynx, oropharynx and in the oral cavity. \r\n\r\nThe National Head and Neck Cancer Audit is commissioned and sponsored by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP) and developed in partnership with the British Association of Head and Neck Oncologists (BAHNO). The Health and Social Care Information Centre provides project management and technical infrastructure. \r\n\r\nThe National Head and Neck Cancer Audit 2012, Eighth Annual Report provided information that represents 7726 cases of head and neck cancer from England and 546 cases from Wales. The report, therefore, represents a comprehensive overview of head and neck cancer care, and this supporting dataset contains those England indicators in the report. \r\n\r\nThe National Head and Neck Cancer Audit 2011-2012 covers the time period from 1st November 2011 to 31st October 2012. Trusts and networks within England are included. ",
