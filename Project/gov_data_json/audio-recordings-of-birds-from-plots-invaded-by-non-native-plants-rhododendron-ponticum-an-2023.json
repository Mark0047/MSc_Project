        "notes": "[This dataset is embargoed until October 1, 2025]. This dataset contains audio recordings of birds in four woodland plots invaded by the non-native species Rhododendron ponticum or Prunus laurocerasus and non-invaded control plots in the same woodlands. The four locations were in Wales; Nercwys Forest; Penllergare, Swansea; Aberkenfig; and Wye Valley, Cleddon Shoots. Recordings were conducted in hourly intervals in the morning and evening for one or two days in each location, between June and September 2023. The aim of the data collection was to analyse if any differences in the number of bird species and frequency of bird calls could be found between invaded and non-invaded woodland plots. This is the complete dataset. The work was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council (Grant NE/X013332/1). Full details about this dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5285/7f11ef69-36e6-4e42-b826-f11c158a0845",
