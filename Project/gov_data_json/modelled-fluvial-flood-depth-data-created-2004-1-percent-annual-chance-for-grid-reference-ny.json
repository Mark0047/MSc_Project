        "notes": "This modelled fluvial flood depth data was created for the 1%  annual chance of flooding situations and was produced as a by-product from the 2004 generalised modelling project. The purpose of the generalised modelling project was to fill the gaps where there was no detailed local modelled data in 2004, in order to define the extents of Flood Zones for spatial planning. \n\nA two-dimensional hydrodynamic model called JFlow was used to produce this modelled fluvial flood depth data on a 5x5m grid.\n\nSince 2004, local detailed modelling has been used to replace this generalised modelling in many areas to define the extents of Flood Zones. However this depth dataset has not been updated. \n\nINFORMATION WARNING: This data is not suitable for identifying whether an individual property will flood, for detailed decision making or for use in site specific Flood Risk or Strategic Flood Risk Assessments. Where this data is used for anything other than broad catchment or Shoreline Management Plan scale further evidence, verification and studies should be undertaken.\n\nMore recent, accurate and local detailed modelling depth data is available for many places. Please contact your local Environment Agency office to see if detailed modelling is available for your area of interest. \n\nThis metadata record is for Approval for Access product AfA238 Flood Zone Depth Grid Dataset 2004\n\nModelled fluvial flood depth data are available for the whole of England, however this data is for the 100x100km squared Ordnance Survey National Grid reference NY. If you are interested in data for another grid reference refer to the Ordnance Survey National Grid document linked below to find the relevant referencing code and search on Data.gov.uk again to download the data. \nhttps://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/support/national-grid.pdf Attribution statement: \u00a9 Environment Agency copyright and/or database right 2016.
