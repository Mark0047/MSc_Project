        "notes": "This British Geological Survey (BGS) marine geophysical survey took place in June/July 2001 in the UK designated area north of 62N aboard the RSS Discovery (Cruise D254). The purpose was to gather data which could be used to map the regional geology of the area. A total of 3329 km of generally good quality data were collected in a grid of 24 survey tracks. Sea floor data were collected using an echo-sounder. Subsurface data were gathered using a suite of seismic instruments (airgun, sparker, pinger), plus a gravity meter and a magnetometer. Most of the data were recorded digitally, but paper records were generated also. The data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS Internal Report IR/01/178.",
