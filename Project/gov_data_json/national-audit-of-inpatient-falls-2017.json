        "notes": "The National Audit of Inpatient Falls (NAIF) is designed to capture data from acute, community and mental health hospitals relating to falls, and is based on NICE guidance and advice from NHS Improvement (NHSI). \r\n\r\nHospital inpatients in England experienced a quarter of a million falls during the year 2015/16.1 These\r\nwere spread across acute, community and mental health hospitals. Falls are commonly reported patient\r\nsafety incidents and result in:\r\n\uf0b7 over 2,500 hip fractures2\r\n\uf0b7 loss of confidence and slower recovery, even when physical harm is minimal\r\n\uf0b7 distress to families and staff\r\n\uf0b7 litigation against hospital trusts\r\n\uf0b7 overall costs to hospitals of \u00a3630 million per year.\r\n\r\nAcute illness, particularly in frail older people or those recovering from serious injury or surgery,\r\nincreases the risk of a fall in hospital. Patients are vulnerable to delirium, dehydration and\r\ndeconditioning, all of which affect balance and mobility, especially in unfamiliar surroundings. The\r\nmajority of falls occur among medical inpatients during the first few days after admission.\r\nThese circumstances mean that not all falls are preventable. However, successful implementation of\r\nguidance from NICE may prevent 20\u201330% of falls.4 Prevention depends upon prompt assessment to\r\nidentify potential risk factors, followed by clinical responses to ameliorate their effects. This is a complex\r\ntask requiring a multidisciplinary team approach. One patient may require several individually tailored\r\ninterventions. It also requires a patient safety approach throughout the organisation, with practical\r\nsupport such as walking aids being always available, a culture of reliable incident reporting, and clear\r\naccountability and commitment from senior leaders.\r\n\r\nThe National Audit of Inpatient Falls (NAIF) was designed to capture all these elements. It is based on\r\nNICE guidance and advice from NHS Improvement (NHSI). ",

HQIP is an independent organisation led by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, The Royal College of Nursing, and National Voices and it works in partnership with patients and healthcare professionals to influence and improve healthcare practice at all levels. \r\n\r\nHQIP commissions, manages, supports, and promotes national and local programmes of quality improvement. This includes the national clinical audit programmes, the Clinical Outcome Review Programmes and the National Joint Registry on behalf of NHS England and other healthcare departments and organisations.  \r\n\r\nIn compliance with its commissioning status, HQIP:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Uses best management and procurement practice to ensure robust results and actionable recommendations.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Ensures patients and carers remain at the heart of its work through continued, strategic involvement in all relevant processes and projects.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Supports professionals to review and improve their practice by providing education and training programmes, and opportunities to share best practice as part of promoting an integrated approach to quality improvement.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Works to inform and influence national healthcare policy by effectively communicating its work and that of its partners.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Encourages wide use of robust data for quality improvement of care, offering patient choice, promoting patient safety, supporting revalidation and service accreditation, commissioning, service redesign, and research.\r\n\r\nFurther information about the HQIP Board, the team, and the organisations that HQIP work with is available on the HQIP website at http://www.hqip.org.uk/about-us/.",
