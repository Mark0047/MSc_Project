        "notes": "This marine sampling survey comprised four 2-week legs and formed part of the Rockall Continental Margin Project. It was undertaken from April to June 1994 in the Hatton-Rockall area of the north Atlantic on board the MV Kommandor Therese. The purpose was: 1) to obtain short sea-bed cores for geological calibration of high-resolution seismic profiles obtained in 1992 as part of the same project. 2) to obtain short sea-bed gravity cores, targeted at specific structures, and subsequently geochemically analyse subsamples from these for traces of hydrocarbons. Sea-bed samples and cores were collected using Gravity corer, Vibrocorer and Rockdrill. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS Technical Report WB/94/20C. Geological and geochemical results are contained in report WB/95/11C. Extra geochemical results are contained in WI/95/14C.",
