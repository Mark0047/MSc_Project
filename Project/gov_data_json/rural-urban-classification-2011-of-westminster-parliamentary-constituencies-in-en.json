This part of the Rural Urban Classification is available only for England and complements another part of the classification concerned to classify small areas (Output Areas (OAs); Super Output Areas (SOAs) and wards) in both England and Wales. It is important to appreciate that to a substantial degree the classification in both its new and earlier forms rests on this corresponding lower level classification. This lower level small-area classification was originally developed for a consortium of government agencies for use \u00a0with the 2001 Census and revised following the 2011 Census for a similar consortium which included the Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG), the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and the Welsh Government (WG). The RUCLAD classification was produced by the University of Sheffield and was</span><span style='font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: 18.4px;'>\u00a0sponsored by a cross-Government working group comprising Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Department of the Communities and Local Government and Office for National Statistics.</span><div><span style='font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 18.4px;'><font size='3'><br /></font></span></div><div><span style='font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 18.4px;'><span style='font-family: verdana, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);'><font color='#000000' size='3'>21/06/2017: UPDATED - it was noticed that not all the fields were present on the original - possibly due to a corruption when uploading the CSV file to ArcGIS Online.
