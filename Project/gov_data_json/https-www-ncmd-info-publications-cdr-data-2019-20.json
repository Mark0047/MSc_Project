More specifically, this report includes data on the deaths of children reviewed by Child Death Overview Panels (CDOPs), and so will enable them to determine how they compare with national data. \r\n\r\nThe data included in this report were collected as part of the national Child Death Review (CDR) process in England, which has been in place since 2008 and was established to better understand why children die and reduce the risk of future deaths.
