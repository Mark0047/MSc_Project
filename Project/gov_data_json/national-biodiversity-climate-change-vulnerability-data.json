        "notes": "Natural England has developed a national scale model that undertakes an analysis of current datasets to provide an assessment of the relative vulnerability of priority habitats to climate change based on principles of adaptation for biodiversity. Through this model we are able to spatially represent the relative vulnerability of priority habitats to enable better spatial prioritisation of adaptation action. The methodology uses a 200m2 Geographic Information System (GIS) grid model to assess priority habitats for their overall vulnerability based on 5 metrics \u0096 habitat sensitivity, habitat fragmentation, topographic variety, condition and management and conservation value.",
