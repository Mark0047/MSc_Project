Sea floor data were collected using an echo sounder. Subsurface data were gathered using a pinger, a total of 143km were covered. Seabed samples and cores were collected using a shipek grab, vibrocorer, shell and auger and wireline drilling equipment. Seventeen borehole sites were occupied. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS Internal Report WB/72/4.",
