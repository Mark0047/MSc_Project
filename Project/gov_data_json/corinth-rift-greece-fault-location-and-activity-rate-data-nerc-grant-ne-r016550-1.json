        "notes": "The data are derived from interpretation of seismic reflection profiles within the offshore Corinth Rift, Greece (the Gulf of Corinth) integrated with IODP scientific ocean drilling borehole data from IODP Expedition 381 (McNeill et al., 2019a, 2019b). The data include rift fault coordinate (location, geometry) information and slip rate and extension rate information for the major faults. Seismic reflection data were published in Taylor et al. (2011) and in Nixon et al. (2016). Preliminary fault interpretations and rate data, prior to IODP drilling, were published in Nixon et al. (2016). Details of datasets: The data can be viewed in GIS software (ArcGIS, QGIS) or the Excel and .dbf files can be used for viewing of rate data and import of fault coordinates into other software. The 4 folders are for different time periods with shape files for the N-Dipping and S-Dipping Faults in the offshore Corinth Rift and respective slip and extension (horizontal) rates. The shapefiles are digitised fault traces for the basement offsetting faults, picked from the Multichannel Seismic Data collected by the R/V Maurice Ewing. Fault traces are segmented and each segment has an average throw (vertical) rate (Tavg) in mm/yr. The rates for the segments are averages based on measurements at the ends of each segment. The major fault trace segments also have slip-rates (slip_rate) and extension-rates (ext_rate or extension_) in mm/yr. All rates as well as the names for major faults can be located in the attribute table of the shape files along with X- and Y-coordinates. The coordinate system is WGS84 UTM Zone 34N. The shape files can be loaded into a GIS (ArcGIS, QGIS etc.) allowing mapping and visualization of the fault traces and their activity rates. In addition, the attribute tables are .dbf files found within each folder. These have also been provided as .xlsx (Excel) files which include the fault coordinate information, and slip rates and extension rates along the major faults.
