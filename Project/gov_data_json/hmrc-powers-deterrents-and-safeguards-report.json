        "notes": "Forum to Oversee the Implementation of new HMRC Powers, Deterrents and Safeguards: annual reports\r\n\r\nThe Review of HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) Powers, Deterrents and Safeguards ran from 2005 to 2012. It was a programme of consultation and legislative change to provide a modern framework of law and practice for tax administration. Its aim was to secure the benefits of the merger of HM Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue by aligning powers, deterrents and safeguards across the taxes and duties administered by HMRC, where it made sense to do so.\r\n\r\nFurther information on the Review of Powers, Deterrents and Safeguards is available in the National Archives. (See additional links)\r\n\r\nIn 2009 the Implementation Oversight Forum was established. This Forum was set up to provide assurance to the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury and the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) Chairman and Commissioners that the policy outcomes of the review of powers, deterrents and safeguards were being delivered in line with the undertakings given to Parliament. The forum brought together HMRC officials with representatives from a number of representative, regulatory and advisory bodies all of whom had an interest in how HMRC implemented the new powers and safeguards. The first meeting was on 30 March 2009 with the final meeting being held on 21 February 2013. \r\n\r\nFurther information on the Implementation Oversight forum, including its membership and minutes, is available in the National Archives. (See additional links)\r\n\r\nThe Implementation Oversight Form produced three annual reports for the Minister responsible for HMRC. They are historic documents from this forum, and do not reflect current HMRC policy. The data compiled in the reports are in a format specifically for the Forum. HMRC will not continue to gather or publish this data in that format going forward.",
