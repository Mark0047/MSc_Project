        "notes": "This Fisheries Science Partnership (FSP) project was a collaboration between \nindustry and scientists, responding to the need for data from the main small \npelagic fisheries in the South West coast of England. It had three primary \nobjectives: i) to collaborate, improve and continue the self\u2010sampling \ntime\u2010series of biological data collected on sardine from commercial catches in \nsupport of the stock assessment; ii) to engage the Lyme Bay fishermen in a \nself\u2010sampling programme to collect biological data on sprat needed for the \nstock assessment and iii) to run an industry\u2010based acoustic survey in parallel \nwith the existing scientific PELTIC survey to involve industry in the process \nof collecting fisheries independent data and to investigate several queries \nfrom industry about the validity of the Cefas PELTIC survey (effects of timing \nand lack of shallow water coverage on biomass estimate).",
