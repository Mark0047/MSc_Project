        "notes": "The latest population figures produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on\u00a028 June 2018 show that an estimated 534,800 people live in Bradford District \u2013 an increase of 2,300 people (0.4%) since the previous year.\n\nBradford District is the fifth largest metropolitan district (in terms of population) in England, after Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield and Manchester although the District\u2019s population growth is lower than other major cities.\n\nThe increase in the District\u2019s population is largely due to \u201cnatural change\u201d- there have been around 3,300 more births than deaths, although this has been balanced by a larger number of people leaving Bradford to live in other parts of the UK than coming to live here and a lower number of international migrants. In 2016/17 the net internal migration was -2,700 and the net international migration was 1,700.\n\nA large proportion of Bradford\u2019s population is dominated by the younger age groups. More than one-quarter (29%) of the District\u2019s population is aged less than 20 and nearly seven in ten people are aged less than 50. Bradford has the highest percentage of the under 16 population in England after the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham, Slough Borough Council and Luton Borough Council.\n\nThe population of Bradford is ethnically diverse. The largest proportion of the district\u2019s population (63.9%) identifies themselves as White British. The district has the largest proportion of people of Pakistani ethnic origin (20.3%) in England.\n\nThe largest religious group in Bradford is Christian (45.9% of the population). Nearly one quarter of the population (24.7%) are Muslim. Just over one fifth of the district\u2019s population (20.7%) stated that they had no religion.\n\nThere are 216,813 households in the Bradford district. Most households own their own home (29.3% outright and 35.7% with a mortgage). The percentage of privately rented households is 18.1%. 29.6% of households were single person households.\n\nInformation from the Annual Population Survey in December 2017 found that Bradford has 228,100 people aged 16-64 in employment. At 68% this is significantly lower than the national rate (74.9%). \u00a091,100 (around 1 in 3 people) aged 16-64, are not in work. The claimant count rate is 2.9% which is higher than the regional and national averages.\n\nSkill levels are improving with 26.5% of 16 to 74 year olds educated to degree level. 18% of the district\u2019s employed residents work in retail/wholesale. The percentage of people working in manufacturing has continued to decrease from 13.4% in 2009 to 11.9% in 2016. This is still higher than the average for Great Britain (8.1%).",
