        "notes": "The dataset describes the potential of bedrock aquifers across Scotland to sustain various levels of borehole water supply, and the dominant groundwater flow type in each aquifer. There are five aquifer productivity classes: very high, high, moderate, low and very low, and three groundwater flow categories: significant intergranular flow; mixed fracture/intergranular flow; and fracture flow. The dataset is a tool to indicate the location and productivity of bedrock aquifers across Scotland. It may have several uses, including in policy analysis and development; to prioritise aquifer and site investigations; to inform planning decisions; and to improve awareness of groundwater in general. The complexity and heterogeneity of geological formations means that the dataset is only a guide. It is designed to be used at a scale of 1:100,000, and not to assess aquifer conditions at a single point. Latest version: Bedrock aquifer productivity Scotland version 2",
