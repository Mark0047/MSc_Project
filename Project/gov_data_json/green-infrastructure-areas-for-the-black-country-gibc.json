        "notes": "Overview\nThe Green Infrastructure Areas for the Black Country (GIBC) data identifies green infrastructure, green infrastructure function (or ecosystem service) and pinch point mapping for the Black Country area which includes Wolverhampton, Walsall, Sandwell and Dudley.\nThe analysis was carried out in two stages and as a result of this, four datasets were produced:\n\u2018GIBC 01 - Typology & Functionality OS\u2019\n\u2018GIBC 02 \u2013 Pinch Points OS\u2019\n\u2018GIBC 03 \u2013 Pinch Points Consortium Housing\u2019\n\u2018GIBC 04 \u2013 Pinch Points Housing Land Availability\u2019\nFirst Stage Processing\nOrdnance Survey data was used as the base layer for all the processing. The first process produced the \u2018GIBC 01 - Typology & Functionality OS\u2019 dataset. This dataset is then subsequently used as a basis for the production of the second, third and fourth datasets during the second stage.\nIn the first stage each OS polygon was assigned a green infrastructure category based on the SPADES project from the list below.  \nGreen Infrastructure Categories are:\nGarden\nGreen corridor\nPocket park\nPark or garden\nOutdoor sports facility\nChildren\u2019s play space\nYouth area\nBroadleaved woodland\nMixed woodland\nConiferous woodland\nNatural and semi-natural open spaces\nPasture or meadow\nWetland\nWatercourse\nFresh water body\nAllotments\nOrchard\nCemetery or churchyard\nOpen space around premises\nAgricultural land\nRoad island/verge\nRailway corridor\nAbandoned, ruderal and derelict area\nThe OS polygon was then assigned \u201cA function beneficial to people\u201d dependent on the Green Infrastructure Category already assigned. The 26 categories that perform a \u201cfunction beneficial to people\u201d are:\nAccessible water storage \nCarbon storage \nCommunity cohesion \nConnection with local environment \nCorridor for wildlife \nCulture \nEncouraging green travel \nEvaporative cooling \nFlow reduction through surface roughness \nHabitat for wildlife \nHeritage \nInaccessible water storage \nLearning \nLocal food production \nPollination \nPollutant removal from soil/water \nProviding jobs \nRecreation - private \nRecreation - public \nRecreation - public with restrictions \nShading from the sun \nTrapping air pollutants \nVisual contribution to landscape character \nWater conveyance \nWater infiltration \nWater interception \nIn its simplest form the process flow looks like this: \nOS base layer \u2192 assigned green infrastructure \u2192 assigned function\n(Eg - OS polygon \u2192 coniferous woodland \u2192 shading from the sun)\nThe first dataset, \u2018GIBC 01 - Typology & Functionality OS\u2019, therefore shows the following:\nThe green infrastructure category\nThe function beneficial to people\nShows areas of greatest need for this function.\nShows areas whereby the function has been met.\nShows areas whereby the function has not been met.\nSecond Stage Processing\nThe second stage expands on the first by establishing which areas suffer from stress associated with investment in growth and redevelopment of land. These areas are known as \u2018pinch points\u2019. \nWherever there is a high level of need for a particular function (identified in the first process), a potential \u2018pinch point\u2019 exists. \nThe pinch point categories that have been identified are:\nAir Quality Pinch\nCulture Pinch\nFlooding Pinch\nHeat Stress Pinch\nHeritage Pinch\nLocal Community Pinch\nMental Health Pinch\nNature Pinch\nPhysical Activity Pinch\nRecreation Pinch\nSustainable Travel Pinch\nThe second dataset, \u2018GIBC 02 \u2013 Pinch Points OS\u2019, takes the analysis from the first stage process and using the Ordnance Survey data as a base layer, displays the \u2018pinch points\u2019 analysis results. \nThe third dataset, \u2018GIBC 03 \u2013 Pinch Points Consortium Housing\u2019, takes the analysis from the first stage process and rather than using the OS as a base uses the Consortium Housing Site data instead to display \u2018pinch points\u2019.\nThe fourth dataset, \u2018GIBC 04 \u2013 Pinch Points Housing Land Availability\u2019, takes the analysis from the first stage process and rather than using the OS as a base used the Strategic Housing Land Availability data instead to display \u2018pinch points\u2019.\nConclusion\nThe \u2018pinch point\u2019 mapping can help identify particular areas of stress, which when used in conjunction with the green infrastructure and function mapping from the first stage process can be used to help alleviate those stresses.
