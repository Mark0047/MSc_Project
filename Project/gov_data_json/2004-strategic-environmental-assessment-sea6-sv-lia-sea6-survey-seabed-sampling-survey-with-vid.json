The survey objectives were to conduct a strategic environmental study of locations where features of interest had been previously identified by organisations such as the Countryside Council for Wales and the School of Ocean Sciences. Survey operations were focused on the following features: Possible methane-derived carbonate reefs in Cardigan Bay; Gassy Sediments in Tremadog Bay, Biogenic Reefs - Horse mussel beds. \n\n36 video files are available. 186 photographs are available. 52 samples were collected using a Day Grab. A cruise report is available\nProcessed data mosaics are available",
