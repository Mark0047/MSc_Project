        "notes": "The number of planning applications granted as a percentage of all major and minor schemes\n\n#### How the figure is calculated:\r\n\r\nThe number of planning applications for major or minor schemes granted within the reporting period; divided by the total number of planning applications for major or minor schemes on which a decision was made within the same period; multiplied by 100.\r\n\r\nA major development is one where the number of residential dwelling units to be constructed is 10 or more, or where the number of residential units is not given then the site area is 0.5 hectares or more. For all other uses a major development is one where the floor space to be built is 1,000 square metres or more, or where the site area is 1 hectare or more. \r\n\r\nFor dwellings, minor development is one where the number of dwellings to be constructed is between 1 and 9 inclusive, or where the site area is less than 0.5 hectares. For all other uses, a minor development is one where the floor space to be built is less than 1,000 square metres or where the site area is less than 1 hectare.\r\n\r\nOther Developments include:\r\n* Minerals e.g. Mineral handling installations, bricks/pottery manufacture, pipelines, conveyors\r\n* Change of use (outside of major and minor developments), or permitted developments with change of use.\r\n* Householder developments within the curtilage of residential e.g. extensions, alterations, garages, swimming pools, walls, fences, vehicular accesses, porches and satellite dishes. \r\n* Advertisement displays\r\n* Listed building consents (to alter/extend/demolish)\r\n* Certificates of lawful development\r\n* Notifications\r\n\r\n#### Why is this indicator in the business plan?\r\n\r\nThis provides a proxy measure for the impact of the planning measures in the Growth Review. It covers the types of development that are most closely associated with growth.\r\n\r\n#### How often is it updated?\r\n\r\nQuarterly\r\n\r\n####Where does the data come from?\r\n\r\nPSF returns from planning authorities. Published figures are in Table P131 at  [https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-planning-application-statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-planning-application-statistics).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What area does the headline figure cover?\r\n\r\nEngland\r\n\r\n#### Are further breakdowns of the data available?\r\n\r\nBy local planning authority\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What does a change in this indicator show?\r\n\r\nA change in this indicator would show a change in the overall level of approvals. We would not expect this to reach 100% as this would indicate all applications being accepted. A high and consistent approval rate would indicate good performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Time Lag\r\n\r\nPublished within three months of the end of the reporting period.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Next available update\r\n\r\nJune 2015.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Type of Data\r\n\r\nNational Statistics\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Robustness and data limitations\r\n\r\nThe returns submitted by local planning authorities undergo thorough validation and checks. Inconsistent data highlighted during validation and checks are verified by contacting the local authority. Late returns are pursued to ensure the overall response rate is as high as possible. Where a response rate of 100% is not achieved estimates are imputed for non-responding authorities.\r\n\r\nImputation is carried out for non-responding authorities and is calculated using historical information. The process is carried out within groups of authorities which are categorised by their location. The imputed estimates are aggregated together with information from those authorities who responded to calculate the England level information.\r\n\r\n#### Links to Further Information\r\n\r\n[https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government/series/planning-applications-statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government/series/planning-applications-statistics)\r\n\r\n#### Contact Details\r\n\r\n[CorporatePerformance@communities.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:CorporatePerformance@communities.gsi.gov.uk)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
