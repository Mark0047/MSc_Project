        "notes": "Data were collected in 2017, to provide information on spatial patterns of dune migration rates and associated water flow characteristics, at locations on the South Saskatchewan River, Canada. Dune migration rates were measured using repeat aerial imagery. Bedform crests were digitised in individual images, and average dune migration rates were calculated from the mean migration distance between image pairs, divided by the time between image collection. Water depth and velocity data were collected using a Sontek M9 acoustic Doppler current profiler (aDcp) mounted on a small zodiac boat. The position of the aDcp was recorded using a RTK dGPS system. Data were collected on 12th June 2017 as part of NERC project NE/L00738X/1 Full details about this dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5285/864434b7-2102-4edc-802d-ebdbfe9ff766",
