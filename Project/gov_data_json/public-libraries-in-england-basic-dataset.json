They may be different to those in other sources.\r\n\r\nThis basic dataset provides a definitive source of data on public libraries in England that everyone can point to and use. \r\n\r\nThis dataset forms the [basis of a wider core dataset](https://librariestaskforce.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/30/library-data-the-story-so-far-and-next-steps/) for public libraries in England. Building on this initial exercise, we are looking to improve existing data collection (largely focused on inputs and outputs). We also aim to capture data which covers outcomes and impacts, and the wider variety of activities libraries undertake.\r\n\r\nThis dataset has been validated by all 151 library services in England, but handling this quantity of data means the occasional error is possible.
