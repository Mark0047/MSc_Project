        "notes": "At the end of 2019 the Greater London Authority (GLA) commissioned the Social Market Foundation (SMF) to conduct research focusing on how the outcomes of graduates who have studied in London and those from London vary, by a range of different characteristics.\n\nThis research uses a range of methods to gain insight into the outcomes of graduates who were domiciled in London prior to university and those who studied at a London institution. In particular, the SMF undertook a literature review of academic, government and policy papers on degree outcomes and the factors that interact with these; conducted descriptive analysis of data provided by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA); and ran a series of logit regression models to look further into how different characteristics influence graduate outcomes when controlling for other variables. The data includes young first degree students studying at a Higher Education Institution within London and students domiciled in London prior to university who study outside of the capital. The data includes four cohorts from the academic years 2010/11 to 2013/14.",
