This holding contains the four raster layers \nprovided to all participants for the East of Haig Fras MCZ and the groundtruth \nsamples. These four rasters are: Multibeam echosounder bathymetry, multibeam \nechosounder backscatter, modelled maximum current velocity at the seabed and \nmodelled mean current velocity at the seabed. All rasters are in UTM29N \nprojection at a 2 m x 2 m resolution. The groundtruth samples were derived \nfrom drop camera still images of rock substrate and sediment substrate samples \nwere derived from grabs classified using Particle Size Analysis. Groundtruth \nsamples contain the field \"Test\". Test values of 0 were used to train the \nmodels and values of 1 were withheld from all analysts as an independent test \nset.",
