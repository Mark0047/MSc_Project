        "notes": "This is one of the 7 domains of the IMD, the indicators used in the latest update of this domain are; - Average test score of pupils at Key Stage 2 - Average test score of pupils at Key Stage 3 - Best of 8 average capped points score at Key Stage 4 (this includes results of GCSEs, GNVQs and other vocational equivalents) - Proportion of young people not staying on in school or non-advanced education above the age of 16 - Secondary school absence rate - Proportion of those aged under 21 not entering higher education - Proportion of working age adults with no or low qualifications The methodology for producing this domain changed between 2004 and 2007. The longer time series in Key Stage 2 results allowed weighted average of results to be taken in 2007; this reduced the variability in the results. More information about this domain can be found in Chapter 2, Section 5 of the English Indices of Deprivation 2007 report.",
