        "notes": "This datasets contains the anonymised results of a survey of well owners in Kisumu, Kenya. Data includes information on the amount of water abstracted daily from the well and ways in which this water was used and handled, information on other sources of water (e.g. piped utility water and rainwater) and how this is used, and the assets and services that the well owner has access to. Answers from questions to assess food poverty are also included. The surveys were carried out during February and March 2014 and include data from 51 well owners. The data were collected as part of the Groundwater2030 project, which aims to reduce the health problems that result from consumption of contaminated groundwater in urban areas of Africa. The project was co-ordinated by the University of Southampton, with partners at the University of Surrey, the Victoria Institute of Research on Environment and Development (VIRED) International, and the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology. The project was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council and the Department for International Development as part of the Unlocking the Potential of Groundwater for the Poor (UPGro) programme.
