Its purpose is to gather information about the pathway of care for patients with carotid stenosis who undergo carotid interventions (either surgery or endovascular stenting). Data allows the audit to follow the patient journey and compare clinical performance with national guidelines for care delivery.\r\n\r\nThe audit covers carotid endarterectomies performed in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. However the data files here on cover information on English NHS trusts.\r\n\r\nThe data here is for Round 4 of the audit, which covered operations undertaken between October 2010 and September 2011 that were submitted to the National Vascular Database by the end of December 2011.\r\n",
