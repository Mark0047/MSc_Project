        "notes": "This measures percentage point differences in the proportions of each Black Minority and Ethnic (BME) group of young people on youth justice disposals against the proportions of each BME group in the equivalent local population. BME main groups are classified as those main groups in the 2001 census. The ONS latest mid-year estimated figures used for the local youth population by BME group. It is important to do the analysis by each of the ethnic groups and not the overall BME group, otherwise the under-represented groups counter-balance the over-represented groups \u2013 giving the false impression there is no over-representation of particular BME groups. Areas would only need to submit values for the number of offenders in each ethnic group, as the local population data would be sourced from ONS to do the required calculations. Young people are those aged 10-17 years.",
