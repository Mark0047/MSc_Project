        "notes": "The proportion of children experiencing income deprivation. The material well-being index is a comprehensive, non-overlapping count of children living in households in receipt of both in-work and out-of-work means-tested benefits. The numerator is a simple sum of children aged 0-15 living in low-income households while the denominator is total number of children aged 0-15. Thus, the domain score for each LSOA in the CWI is the proportion of its 0-15 year old children who are living in low-income households. The indicators are summed and expressed as a rate of the total child population aged 0-15",
