Surveys associated with this reserach 1968/2 and 1968/8. Additonal samples were collected from the Spurn Bight tidal flats either by inflatable boat or on foot.The purpose was to collect sedimentological and geological structure data for use in a tidal model. Sediment samples were collected using a Shipek grab and a gravity corer. These data archived by BGS. Details of the survey are contained in BGS Technical report WB/MC/69/3.",
