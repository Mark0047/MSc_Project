Local trawlermen working in the Bristol Channel and the South \nWales Sea Fisheries Committee suggested that square-mesh panels fitted into \ntrawls used to catch bass could reduce discards of undersize bass. A trawl was \nmodified to incorporate a square-mesh section and was tested on board the MFV \nCerulean against a control trawl.\n\nIn August 2009, 46 hauls were conducted. Catches were sampled and video \nfootage was taken of fish behaviour at the square-mesh section.",
