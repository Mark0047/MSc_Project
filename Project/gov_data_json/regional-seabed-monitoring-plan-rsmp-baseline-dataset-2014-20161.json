        "notes": "This dataset was compiled for the Regional Seabed Monitoring Plan (RSMP) \nbaseline assessment reported in Cooper & Barry (2017). The dataset comprises \nof 33,198 macrofaunal samples (83 percent with associated data on sediment \nparticle size composition) covering large parts of the UK continental shelf. \nWhilst most samples come from existing datasets, also included are 2,500 new \nsamples collected specifically for the purpose of this study. These new \nsamples were collected during 2014-2016 from the main English aggregate \ndredging regions (Humber, Anglian, Thames, Eastern English Channel and South \nCoast) and at four individual, isolated extraction sites where the RSMP \nmethodology is also being adopted (e.g. Area 457, North-West dredging region; \nArea 392, North-West dredging region; Area 376, Bristol Channel dredging \nregion; Goodwin Sands, English Channel). This work was funded by the \naggregates industry, and carried out by contractors on their behalf. Samples \nwere collected in accordance with a detailed protocols document which included \ncontrol measures to ensure the quality of faunal and sediment sample \nprocessing. Additional samples were acquired to fill in gaps in spatial \ncoverage and to provide a contemporary baseline for sediment composition. \nSources of existing data include both government and industry, with \ncontributions from the marine aggregate dredging, offshore wind, oil and gas, \nnuclear and port and harbour sectors. Samples have been collected over a \nperiod of 48 years from 1969 to 2016, although the vast majority (96%) were \nacquired since 2000. Samples have been collected during every month of the \nyear, although there is a clear peak during summer months when weather \nconditions are generally more favourable for fieldwork.
