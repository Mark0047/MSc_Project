        "notes": "Pre-proposal for scientific drilling 'GlaciStore: Understanding Late Cenozoic glaciation and basin processes for the development of secure large-scale offshore CO2storage (North Sea)', submitted to Integrated Ocean Discovery Programme (IODP) March 2014. The proponent 'GlaciStore' consortium comprises research and industry organisations from the UK and Norway. The pre-proposal describes the scientific research objectives, 12 proposed drill sites to address the objectives, the relationship of the research with the IODP science plan, and describes and illustrates three scientific objectives. The objectives are to investigate the glacial history and sedimentary architecture, fluid flow and processes, and the stress history and geomechanical response in strata that have experienced multiple glacial and interglacial cycles cycles. A drilling and sampling strategy and the measurements expected to be taken are also described The lead submitter, on behalf to the GlaciStore consortium is Heather Stewart, British Geological Survey (BGS).The 27 proponents from the UK and Norway (BGS, Institute for Energy Technology, Lundin Norway AS, SINTEF Energy Research, Statoil ASA, University of Bergen, University of Edinburgh and University of Oslo) and their expertise are listed. The pre-proposal is a pdf format file. This is restricted to the proponents for publication and to progress to full proposal to IODP. UKCCSRC Grant UKCCSRC-C1-30.",
