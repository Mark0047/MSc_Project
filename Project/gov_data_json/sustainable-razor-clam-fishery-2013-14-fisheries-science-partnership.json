        "notes": "The fishing vessel *Harmoni *(MR7) was chartered to carry out experimental \nelectro-fishing for razor clams. The aim of the survey was to establish \nwhether a commercial fishery with this gear was viable commercially and \nenvironmentally sustainable.\n\nThere was initially a period of gear design and construction which, together \nwith some unavailability of either the vessel of Cefas staff, delayed the \nproject until the winter of 2013/14. The weather was exceptionally poor and \ndelayed the start of work such that funding had to be carried forward into the \nnext financial year. Fieldwork commenced in May at a site off Southport, but \ndespite the experimental gear deploying and working as envisaged, no razor \nclams were caught.\n\nIt was decided that a new fishing area should be tried and at the suggestion \nof the skipper, a diving company was engaged to survey positions where catches \nhad been made previously. One position was found to have a significant density \nof razor clams and this was chosen as a target for the next trip. \nUnfortunately this position was in too shallow water for *Harmoni *to reach \nand deploying the gear a short distance to seaward produced no catch. After \nfurther tows through the area which also proved barren, the project was \nabandoned.",
