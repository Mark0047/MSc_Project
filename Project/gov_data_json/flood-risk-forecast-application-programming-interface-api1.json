It provides the indication of the potential for flooding for five days: the day on which it is issued and the subsequent four days ahead.The forecast highlights flood risk on a county by county basis and includes a short commentary on the situation. It covers flooding from rivers, the sea, surface water and groundwater for Wales and England.This dataset is produced in partnership with the Met Office Flood Forecasting Centre and the Environment Agency and is intended to complement the Flood Warning Service provided by Natural Resources Wales.\r\n    ",
