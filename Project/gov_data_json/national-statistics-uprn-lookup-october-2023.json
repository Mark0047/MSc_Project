The NSUL relates the Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN) for each GB address from AddressBase\u00ae Epoch 104 to a range of current statutory administrative, electoral, health and other statistical geographies via 'best-fit' allocation from 2021 Census output areas (National Parks and Workplace Zones are exempt from 'best-fit' and use 'exact-fit' allocations). The NSUL is produced by ONS Geography, who provide geographic support to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and geographic services used by other organisations. The NSUL is issued every 6 weeks and is designed to complement the Ordnance Survey AddressBase\u00ae product. For further technical information about this file, please refer to the User Guide document contained within the downloadable zip file.
