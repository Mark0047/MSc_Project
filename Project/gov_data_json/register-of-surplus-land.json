        "notes": "*** THIS DATA IS UPDATED DAILY *** The Register provides information on the availability of surplus land for those government departments and their sponsored bodies which fall under the responsibility of English Ministers. The Register is also used on a voluntary basis by NHS trusts and Welsh Government.   The land records are presented as points data.  This dataset does not include the land parcel boundaries.  The Register helps to ensure that wider Government objectives, including housing needs are factored into land disposal decisions.  Through the Register, the disposing body provides details of the site and there is a window of 40 working days during which certain public sector bodies can identify new uses for the land.  \r\n\r\nThe dataset available on data.gov.uk covers all sites that are outside the 40 working day \u2018window\u2019. Such sites may be included in the disposal strategies that have been published by a number of individual government departments. In addition, these sites may now be \u2018on the market\u2019 and being actively marketed.  The \u2018Register of Public Sector Land\u2019 dataset provides details of any sites that are being disposed of through the Register of Surplus Public Sector Land and are outside the 40 working day \u2018window\u2019 Certain properties may have more than one entry in the data extract as government has more than one \u2018interest\u2019 in that property.   Again, the extract provides information about the \u2018owning\u2019 government department and the \u2018property centre\u2019, i.e. that part of the government department responsible for that property. In addition, it has a property reference (the \u2018ePIMS Property Ref\u2019) that allows it to be linked to the other data extracts.  \r\n\r\nThe scope of the data includes land and property information for those government departments, together with any arms\u2019 length bodies for which they are responsible, including their non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs), which fall under the responsibility of English Ministers.  These assets are primarily located in England, but are also located in the devolved administrations of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales as well as overseas. Also, some Local Authorities have chosen to publish their property data as part of our transparency exercise.
