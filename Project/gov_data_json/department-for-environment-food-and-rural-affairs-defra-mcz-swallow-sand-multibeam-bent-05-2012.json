On completion of the sampling grid an additional multibeam (bathymetry and backscatter) survey was undertaken in the western region of the rMCZ to target areas of coarse sediments identified to be present by the ground-truthing survey and the opportunistic multibeam survey. These data are archived with the Marine Environmental Data and Information Network (MEDIN) Data Archive Centres (DACs) including the British Geological Survey (BGS) DAC for geology and geophysics, The Archive for Marine Species and Habitats Data (DASSH) and the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO) bathymetry DAC. The full site data package including raw is also available on request from BGS.",
