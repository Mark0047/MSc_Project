This project\u00a0is to extend the mapped coverage of the Eastern English Channel Marine Habitat Map (EECMHM) to include the coastal platform from Saltdean east to Dungeness and provide an integrated map dataset covering this extension area The geophysical data was acquired using Surface Tow Boomer and Sidescan sonar equipment. Technical detail of the survey are contained in BGS Open Report OR/10/052.",
