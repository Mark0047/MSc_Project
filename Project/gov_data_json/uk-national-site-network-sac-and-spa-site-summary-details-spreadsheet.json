        "notes": "This spreadsheet contains the latest UK-wide data gathered as part of the Standard Data Form (SDF) information completed for all sites in the UK National Site Network.  It contains details of all Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs) in the UK (note that Gibraltar information is not included in this spreadsheet). The spreadsheet was last updated in October 2023 to ensure consistency across reporting.\n\nThe information follows the officially agreed site information format as set out in the Official Journal of the European Union recording the Commission Implementing Decision of 11 July 2011 (2011/484/EU). Whilst the UK no longer submits data to the European Commission, it continues to produce SDFs using the Natura 2000 format.\n\nThis spreadsheet is organised in a series of tabs, corresponding to different sections of the SDF. On some tabs, SPA and SAC data are separated, whereas on others they are combined. Where they are combined, there is a column to indicate the type of site (SAC or SPA). All sheets are filterable by Country codes - (E, S, W, NI and O for offshore UK). Lower case \"i\" indicates that a site is inshore e.g. S(i) for Scotland (inshore). The country code of E, S, W, or NI not followed by \"i\" indicates it is a terrestrial zone e.g. E for England (terrestrial). Cross border sites are shown via a \"_\u00e2\u0080\u009d e.g. E_W for England (terrestrial)/ Wales (terrestrial), S(i)_O for Scotland (inshore)/Offshore UK. The tabs are:\n\n* SAC site details \u00e2\u0080\u0093 contains summary information about the SACs themselves, including their size, location and date of designation. This tab contains descriptions of the quality/importance of the site and physical characteristics.\n* SPA site details \u00e2\u0080\u0093 contains summary information about the SPAs themselves, including a brief description, their size, location and date of classification. Most of the data are sourced from the SDFs, with the exception of the information in the 'overview' and 'local authority' columns. The list includes all classified SPAs. There is also an indication of which sites contain marine components (i.e. can be considered to be part of the Marine Protected Areas Network).\n* Admin regions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 contains details of the administrative regions for each site using the NUTS Level 2 categories.\n* SAC interest features \u00e2\u0080\u0093 contains a full listing of all interest features occurring on SACs in the UK. This includes non-qualifying ('D-grade') features that are not a reason for SAC selection at a particular site. Note that a feature may not occur on all parts of a site, especially in the case of large SACs.\n* SPA interest features \u00e2\u0080\u0093 shows bird data (i.e. the occurrence of each species on each site). The list of species for each site includes only those listed on the SDF (specifically those listed in section 3.2 of the form). Qualifying assemblages are listed in a separate tab. It does not take account of the recommendations published in the SPA Review except where there has been a subsequent legal amendment to the relevant SPA citation.\n* Maps \u00e2\u0080\u0093 offers a simple mapping facility. If a particular feature or site is selected in the above worksheets using the Autofilter function, a dot map will be displayed showing the location of the site(s).\n* Habitat classes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 indicates the percentage of each SAC/SPA comprised of certain broad habitat types. These are intended to give a general impression of the character of the SAC. They should not be confused with the Annex I habitats, which are listed in the SAC interest feature worksheet.\n* Threats and pressures \u00e2\u0080\u0093 lists the positive and negative factors that impact on the site. These data were collated for the first time in the UK as part of the December 2015 submission to the EU.\n* Designation type \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this refers to a very limited range of National Designations, specifically SSSI (ASSI in Northern Ireland), Marine Nature Reserves and National Nature Reserves.\n* Management Body \u00e2\u0080\u0093 indicates the appropriate Statutory Nature Conservation Bodies.\n* Management plan \u00e2\u0080\u0093 indicates whether or not a management plan exists for the site.\n\nMore general information on Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) in the United Kingdom is available from the [SAC webpage on JNCC's website](https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/special-areas-of-conservation/).
