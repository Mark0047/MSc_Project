        "notes": "<p>This data provides information on the profile of clients that Cambridge &amp; District CAB referred to Cambridge City Foodbank from 1st April 2014 to 31st March 2015 for food and/or fuel vouchers. Information is provided on age, ethnicity, household type, number of adults fed by food voucher, number of children fed by food voucher, housing type and homelessness, mental health or physical health issues and employment status. Information is also provided around benefits the clients receive (earning replacement benefits include Jobseeker's Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, Carer's Allowance, Income Support and State Pension; income-related benefits include Tax Credits, Housing Benefit, Council Tax Reduction, Pension Credits and Child Benefit; disability-related benefits include Disability Living Allowance and Personal Independence Payments). We also note instances of benefit sanctions. Note that none of the details provided here can be traced to individual households - the data has been completely anonymised. All low cell counts of below 5, have been rounded up and replaced with a 5. This prevents any breaches of the Data Protection Act 1998. The data is from the CAB content management system, called Petra, which holds all of our client case notes and profile information.</p>\n",
