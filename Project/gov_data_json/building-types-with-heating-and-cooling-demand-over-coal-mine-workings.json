        "notes": "This dataset has been produced upon collaboration with the Ordnance Survey (OS), in order to produce a geospatial layer to aid in identifying areas which might see the most impact from a mine water heat scheme. It has been designed in order for stakeholders to identify areas which may see the relevant surface level demand and end-user base for mine water heat opportunities.The dataset shows:- the extent of the underground mine workings, at a 5km hex resolution- the distribution of building types across the UK's coalfields- the total annual heating demand (in GWh/yr) per 5km hex- the total annual cooling demand (in GWh/yr) per 5km hexThe dataset does not guarantee the potential of a mine water heat prospect in any of the 5km hex cells. The potential for a mine water heat scheme at any location is subject to a thorough review of the relevant subsurface and environmental data and granting of all permissions, permits and licenses.",

It also manages the effects of past coal mining, including subsidence damage claims which are not the responsibility of licensed coal mine operators; deals with mine water pollution and other coal legacy issues and provides access to the mining information it holds. Its powers were extended in 2011 to enable it to deal with non-coal mine water pollution and subsidence when the necessary funding is made available.\r\n\r\nThe Coal Authority is an executive non-departmental public body of the Department of Energy & Climate Change\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/coalauthority\r\n",
