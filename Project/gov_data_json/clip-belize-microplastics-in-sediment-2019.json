Sediment was collected at six locations in Belize \nbetween May and June 2019, but only four were analysed for microplastics due \nto time restrictions (only PSA reported for the two sites left). The file also \nreports information on blank used for calculations, grab GPS coordinates, \ndeployment time and the particulate size analysis (PSA) of the sediment. \nBelize_Sediment_Microplastics_FTIR.csv contains the profile of a ATR-FT-IR \nspectrum analysis of a plastic particle (>5mm). A READ-ME text file contains \nthe legend of the columns of the csv file. A .zip file contains the picture of \nthe plastic particle analysed with ATR-FT-IR.",
