        "notes": "An investigation into the potential for improving the selectivity for \nwhitefish in the North Sea Nephrops fishery using a cut-away headline trawl.\n\nThe main objectives were to obtain selectivity parameters of the cut-away \nheadline trawl and a typical *Nephrops* trawl in current use in the Farn \nDeeps *Nephrops* fishery, for the main commercial by-catch species.\n\nDuring October 2004, the commercial twin-rig trawler FV Success III carried \nout trials to determine the selectivity characteristics of the cut-away \nheadline trawl and a standard *Nephrops *trawl currently in use in the \nfishery. Success III was typical of this class of twin-rig vessel in the North \nSea *Nephrops *fishery. The vessel was chartered during the period 11 \nOctober \u2013 24 October 2004.\n\nThe single rig vessels FV Endeavour and FV Trudie May were chartered for five \ndays between 10 February and 18 February 2005 to carry out parallel tows with \nthe two nets towed as single rigs.",
