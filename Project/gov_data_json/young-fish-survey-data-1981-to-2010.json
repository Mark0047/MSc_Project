The survey deployed a light 2-meter beam \ntrawl to survey inshore locations for small / young fish around the British \nIsles, predominantly along the south and east coasts. Total numbers of fish \n(identified to species or if not to the highest taxonomic level) were recorded \nat each station, and were measured in the majority of cases. The surveys were \nprimarily undertaken to evaluate the abundance of juvenile sole and plaice, as \nwell as providing further information on the abundance of other species of \nfish. Alongside the main 'Young Fish Survey Data 1981 to 2010' data table are \nthree further data tables marked as 'YFS_DWC' which give the same data in \nEventCore format and a readme file which describes historic versions of \nmetadata which this record has replaced.",
