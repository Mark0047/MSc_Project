This dataset covers monitoring data that is only updated on our systems on a daily update cycle. This is usually increased during times of flooding etc.\nReadings are transferred via telemetry to internal and external systems in or close to real time. This data may be transferred to these systems or users at different intervals varying for example from once per day during normal conditions to several times per day during a flood event.\nData for sites in Wales is included in the Open Data feed, but is owned by Natural Resources Wales (NRW). NRW also class the data as Open Data, and you may use it under the same terms as the England data (the standard Open Government Licence, available on The National Archives website).\nMeasurements of the height (m) of water in a river lake or coastal site taken using automatic field devices usually every 15 mins.  Information is available for 1400 river gauging stations (where flow is also measured) and 1800 river level only monitoring sites throughout England as well as some reservoirs and coastal sites.
