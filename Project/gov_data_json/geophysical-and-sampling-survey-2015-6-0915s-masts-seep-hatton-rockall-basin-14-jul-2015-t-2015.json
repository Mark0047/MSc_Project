        "notes": "This marine geophysical and sampling survey took place from 14 to 27 July 2015 in the area of Hatton-Rockall Basin on board the MRV Scotia. The survey was carried out as a joint venture between partners of the Marine Alliance for Science and Technology in Scotland (MASTS), included (British Geological Survey (BGS), University of Aberdeen, Scottish Association for Marine Science, Marine Scotland Science and National Museum of Wales). The aim of the survey was cold seep habitat detection. Seabed samples were collected using a Gravity corer, van veen grab, megacorer, trawls. The geology component of the data is archived at the British Geological Survey (BGS) MEDIN Data Archive Centre (DAC) for Geology and Geophysics. Biological data are archived at DASSH. Technical details of the survey are contained in the Report of Survey.",
