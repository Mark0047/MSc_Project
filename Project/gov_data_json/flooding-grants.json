It covers the risk of flooding from local sources, namely Ordinary Watercourses, surface water (overland runoff) and groundwater. It\u00a0does not\u00a0directly consider flooding from main rivers.\u00a0This report has helped us to develop our strategy to manage local flooding in Leeds.\n\n**Local Flood Risk Management Strategy (LFRMS):**\n\nAs Lead Local Flood Authority for Leeds, Leeds City Council has developed a Local Flood Risk Management Strategy. The scope of this strategy covers all sources of flooding. It focuses on \u2018local flooding\u2019 that originates from ordinary watercourses, surface water, sewers (rainfall only) and groundwater. It also includes Main River flooding and although this is primarily the Environment Agency\u2019s responsibility; however, its inclusion here allows the impact on the local situation to be recognised.\u00a0The purpose of this strategy is to guide the activities undertaken by Risk Management Authorities operating in the metropolitan district of Leeds. These are Leeds City Council, the Environment Agency, Yorkshire Water Services, Ainsty Internal Drainage Board and Highways England.",
