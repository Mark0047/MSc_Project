Time series of surface water temperatures can provide indicators of climate change and associated ecological responses. An archive was created in 2007 as part of a research project (SC070035), and is a unique collation of the Environment Agency\u2019s water temperature data from more than 30,000 sites across England & Wales. \nThe archive contains water temperature data (up to 2007) and site metadata. Most sites have records starting from the 1980s. The water temperature data are available in two main types; spot samples from routine monitoring (e.g. monthly) and high resolution samples (e.g. every 15 minutes). \nThe database was created using Microsoft Access 2003 but has a simple query based front end. As part of the science project about 1 in 10 sites were analysed to assess trends, and images of these graphs are embedded within the archive and linked to sites for information. \nThe archive can be interrogated to find out where water temperature data exist, how frequently sampling occurs and the length of each record. In addition, sites have information about water body type e.g. river, lake or canal.  This dataset is available on DVD.\nINFORMATION WARNING \nWithin these data: Site Operator means 'monitoring organisation'; Source Info \u2013 relates to the time the information was provided.
