The presentation describes work carried-out on behalf of the 'Fault seal controls on CO2 storage capacity in aquifers' project funded by the UKCCS Research Centre, grant number UKCCSRC-C1-14. The Captain Sandstone saline aquifer has a potential to store large volumes of CO2 as part of greenhouse gas mitigation strategies, however it is known to be affected by regional faults, some of which extend to the seabed. An in situ stress analysis is performed in order to deduce the stresses affecting these faults and to assess their geomechanical stability.",
