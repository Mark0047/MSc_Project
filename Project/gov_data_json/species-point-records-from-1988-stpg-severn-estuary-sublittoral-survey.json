        "notes": "This survey sampled the area of the Severn Estuary identified by Warwick and Davies (1977) as an area of impoverished fauna. The survey of the Severn Estuary was part of a broader survey, combining an investigation of benthic macrofauna, sediment distribution and transport. Quantitative infaunal samples were obtained from 6 April to 6 May 1988, using a weighted Day Grab (0.1m2 surface area), at points on a grid with intersections at intervals of 1.5 km; sieved through a 0.5 mm mesh. Sampling stations extended from the seaward limit due south of Sker Point (03 45 W) in the west, to the landward limit at the mouth of the River Wye (03 40 W). Where hard substrata occurred, west of 03 20 W stations were unable to be adequately sampled and thus omitted. Single samples were taken (with a few exceptions where small volumes were grabbed, up to 4 replicates were taken) and a sub-sample removed for sediment analysis. 136 stations containing 112 macrobenthic taxa were used in analysis (Mettam et al. 1994), and 8 faunal groups identified. Although 589 stations were sampled, not all have been worked up, and Dr. Mettam requires funding in order to process the remaining samples, all of which cover intermediate positions. [Dr. Chris Mettam (University of Wales College of Cardiff) supplied data for the infaunal samples; Richard Powys, GeoSea (UK) Ltd (Cambridge), was responsible for sediment analysis and supplied the granulometry data. The survey was funded by the Severn Tidal Power Group, and permission to obtain the data was given by Steve Tailor (McAlpine) chairman of STPG meeting board.]",
