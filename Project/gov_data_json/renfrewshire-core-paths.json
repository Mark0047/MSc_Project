        "notes": "The Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 requires that each local authority prepare a Core Paths Plan.  Core Paths are recreation and travel routes which allow the public \"reasonable access\" throughout each local authority area. \r\n\r\nThe Renfrewshire Core Paths Plan 2022 was approved by the Council's Communities, Housing and Planning Board on 18 January 2022.  It is the second Core Paths Plan for Renfrewshire and replaces the Core Path Plan adopted in 2009. \r\n\r\nThe plan sets out a network of key routes which:\r\n\r\nConnect communities, settlements and places of interest\r\nProvide opportunities for active travel, particularly to schools and place of work\r\nConnect people with nature, areas of greenspace and the wider countryside\r\nPromote and encourage healthy lifestyles\r\nThe network provides a series of routes for walkers, cyclists, horse riders and those with disabilities.  Not every route is suitable for everyone and the plan provides information which helps to inform path users on the characteristics of each route.\r\nAdditional information on the Renfrewshire Council Core Paths Plan 2022 is available [here](https://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/article/10769/Renfrewshire-Core-Paths-Plan-2022) ",
