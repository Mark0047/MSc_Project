        "notes": "[This dataset is embargoed until September 1, 2025]. The 3Rs experimental study investigated how trajectories of recovery following a prolonged drought were affected by the prior sediment composition and fine sediment loading. On each of six sampling occasions between December 2022 and March 2023 (Days 1, 8, 13, 29, 57 & 113 following resumption of flow), in each of 12 replicate experimental channels, we collected data on the macroinvertebrate communities on the stream bed surface (benthos), 10cm below the surface of stream bed (hyperheos), and potential colonists dispersing into each of the channels from upstream (drift) and from the aerial insect community (malaise traps). On each occasion we also measured discharge in each of 12 experimental channels as well as the quantity of fine sediment entrained within the stream bed (hyporheic fines). The dataset being deposited contains the following elements: \u2022 Abundance records for discrete taxa found in samples of the: o Dry bed sediment - 2.5 kg of bed sediment removed and examined for any macroinvertebrates still persisting in the drying stream bed. o Re-wetted bed sediment \u2013 2.5 kg of bed sediment removed and retained to identify invertebrates that emerge from the sediments on each sampling day (related article for experimental rehydration of dewatered sediments method description). o Benthos - Surber sample (330 \u00b5m mesh size) of 0.0225m2 area for 30 seconds. A Surber taken from upstream, middle and downstream thirds of the channel length on each occasion. o Hyperheos - 500ml of water extracted using 60ml syringe from standpipes set 10cm below stream bed surface. A sample taken from upstream, middle and downstream thirds of the channel length on each occasion. o Drift - Nets (330 \u00b5m mesh size) deployed for 24hrs at upstream end of each channel. o Aerial communities \u2013 Malaise traps deployed bankside for 5 days. \u2022 Stream discharge (m3s-1)\u2013 stream velocity measured with Valeport 801 Electromagnetic Flowmeter. \u2022 Mass of hyporheic fine sediment (gl-1) \u2013 dry mass of fine sediment extracted with the 500ml hyporheic sample.
