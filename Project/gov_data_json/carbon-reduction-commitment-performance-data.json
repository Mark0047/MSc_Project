The CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme (CRC) Performance Data contains Performance League Tables (PLT) that have been compiled under the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme from data submitted by organisations in their Annual Reports.  CRC requires the highest UK parent organisation to register for CRC and to list all of its significant group undertakings (SGUs), available as an aggregated dataset.  SGUs are undertakings that would qualify for CRC in their own right if they did not have a higher parent organisation. The qualification criterion is that the undertaking was supplied with 6000MWh of qualifying electricity during 2008 (some supplies do not qualify for CRC).  The CRC Order requires that we show in the PLT the undertakings that \"belong\" to a parent, together with a total emissions figure in tonnes/CO2 for that SGU and are presented in a league table based on carbon emissions.  SGU's only apply to the private sector; the public sector will not have SGUs.\n\u2022\tParticipant Data - Detail of each participating organisation, carbon emissions, carbon reduction achievements, energy generated from renewable source and aggregated data.\n\u2022\tPerformance - This is the position in the Overall Performance League Table for a participant.  This is calculated from their performance in each of the individual achievement tables (Early Action; Growth Metric; and Absolute Emissions) after the application of any weighting factors as defined:\nPhase 1 Early Action Weighting (EAW)\tGrowth Weighting (GW)\tAbsolute Weighting (AW)\nYear 1 \t1.00 \t0.00 \t0.00 \nYear 2\t0.40\t0.15 \t0.45 \nYear 3\t0.20\t0.20\t0.60 \nPhase 2 Growth Weighting (GW)\tAbsolute Weighting (AW)\nPhase 2 onwards \t0.25 \t0.75 \nAchievement tables - For each participant the Registry will calculate their Early Action Achievement Table Score based on the following data that has been recorded in the Annual Report for the participant.
