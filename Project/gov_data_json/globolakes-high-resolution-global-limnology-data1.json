These were produced by the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading. \n\nInformation on distance-to-land for each water cell and the distance-to-water for each land cell has many potential applications in remote sensing, where the applicability of geophysical retrieval algorithms may be affected by the presence of water or land within a satellite field of view (image pixel).\n\nThe data was recorded over a 5 year period from 2005-2010 on a global scale. It is expected that new and updated datasets will be added in the future.",
