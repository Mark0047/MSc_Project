These purpose was to collect data as part of a continuation of geochemical sampling programme of superficial bottom seiment for heavy metal analysis. Sea floor data was attempted using MS47 sidescan sonar, equipment failed, no records available.Seabed samples and cores were collected using Shipek grab and a Reineck box corer. These data are archived by BGS. Details of the survey are contained in BGS cruise summary.",
