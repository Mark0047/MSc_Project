        "notes": "This dataset presents daily data from temperature and soil moisture sensors in each experimental plot (n=9 plots) at the Climoor field site. Soil temperature is measured at 5 cm and 20 cm soil depth (degrees Celsius), and soil moisture is measured as soil volumetric water content (m3 per m3). Data were collected from the climate change field site Climoor that is located in Clocaenog forest, NE Wales. The experimental field site consists of three untreated control plots (Plots 3, 6 and 9), three plots where the plant canopy air is artificially warmed during night time hours (Plots 1, 2 and 7) and three plots where rainfall is excluded from the plots at least during the plants' growing season (Plots 4, 5 and 8). Data is an extension for the micromet datasets 1998-2015, 2015-2016 and 2016-2021, covering the time period January 2022 to December 2023. Temperature and moisture data are logged in minute intervals and are averaged as half-hourly. Data were sent from the field site to a UKCEH server. A working copy was created, quality assurance checks carried out and daily averages calculated from half-hourly records. Data which were not recorded are marked as \u201cNA\u201d, faulty data were replaced by \u201c-9999\u201d. Data collection, processing and quality check was carried out by UKCEH staff. The Climoor field experiment intends to answer questions regarding the effects of warming and drought on ecosystem processes. The reported plot level temperature and soil moisture data are important to evaluate the effect of the imposed climatic treatments on ecosystem processes and functioning. More detailed information about the field site, measurements and related datasets can be found in the supporting documentation.
