They replace the 2008-based household projections released in November 2010. \n\nThese figures replace the 2008-based household projections released in November 2010. \r\n\r\nThe household projections are produced by applying projected household representative rates to the population projections published by the Office for National Statistics. Projected household representative rates are based on trends observed in Census and Labour Force Survey data. The assumptions underlying national household and population projections are demographic trend based. They are not forecasts as they do not attempt to predict the impact that future government policies, changing economic circumstances or other factors might have on demographic behaviour. They provide the household levels and structures that would result if the assumptions\r\nbased on previous demographic trends in the population and rates of household formation were to be realised in practice\r\n\r\nThis data is available for download as an [Excel spreadsheet](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/189965/AllTablesNonRegionalFinal__3_.xls)",
