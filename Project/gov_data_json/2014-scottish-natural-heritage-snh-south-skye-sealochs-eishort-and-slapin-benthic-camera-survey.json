        "notes": "The aim of this investigation in South Skye's sea lochs (Eishort and Slapin) was to improve knowledge of the occurrence and distribution of the species and habitats in these two lochs, using DDV drifts at 65 stations. Through the analysis of seabed video, the images were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. Runs and run segments were assessed for the presence of protected features and other PMFs, as well as for the presence of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance.",
