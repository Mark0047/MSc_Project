        "notes": "This 2D Hi-resolution multichannel seismic survey took place September 2009 in the North Channel Basin offshore NE Ireland on board the Fugro Meridian. The survey was carried out by Fugro on behalf of Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)/Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI). The aim was the evaluation of the potential development of offshore gas cavern storage sites in the salt formations of the Permo-Trias. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in FugroReport No.: FSLTD 29-00050 and futher information is available in the reports, A geological interpretation of the nearshore area between Belfast Lough and Cushendun, Northern Ireland, utilising a newly acquired 2D seismic dataset to evaluate salt layers for their potential for gas storage in salt caverns (http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/516832/) and A geomorphological interpretation of multibeam data, nearshore area between Belfast Lough and Cushendun, Northern Ireland (http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/530766/).",
