This covers all elements of remuneration that can be valued (eg. all taxable earnings for the given year, including base salary, variable pay, bonuses, allowances and the cash value of any benefits-in-kind). It uses the median earnings figure as the denominator, which should be that of all employees of the local authority on a fixed date each year, coinciding with reporting at the end of the financial year, and it excludes changes in pension benefits, which due to their variety and complexity cannot be accurately included in a pay multiple disclosure.\r\n",
