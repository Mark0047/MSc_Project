Working age benefits include the main out-of-work client group categories (unemployed people on Jobseekers Allowance, Lone Parents on Income Support, Incapacity Benefits customers, and others on income-related benefits with the exception of carers who are not subject to activation policies in the same way as other groups). The working age population is defined as the sum of females aged 16-59 plus males aged 16-64. Data are presented as a rolling average of 4 quarters to account for seasonal variation.",
