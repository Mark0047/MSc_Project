Study sites included: the Quaternary Broubster Peat Bog, near Thurso in Caithness (study of the migration behaviour and characteristics of U, Th, Ra, Pb, Cu, Zn, organic complexes such as fulvic and humic acids); the Needle's Eye site (Quaternary estuarine and marsh/mudflat sediments) on the Solway Coast of Dumfries and Galloway (study of the migration and retardation behaviour of U in Quaternary sediments and fractured Palaeozoic source rocks); Study of U geochemistry and transport behaviour from uranium-rich mine wastes at the South Terras Mine site, near St Austell, Cornwall; Study of the geochemistry of diffusion of Cl and I from marine source sediments into lacustrine sediments in Quaternary sediments from Loch Lomond. Data consists entirely of published reports of geological, geochemical, hydrochemical petrological and mineralogical information. The data includes descriptive and numerical data but is not digitally available in its present state.",
