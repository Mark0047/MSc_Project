        "notes": "This dataset shows numbers and percentages of pupils on roll in Lincolnshire schools who have Special Educational Needs (SEN). Indicators are included to show whether the outcome is in the form of Support (SEN-K) or an Education, Health and Care Plan (SEN-E).\r\n\r\nThe dataset covers current and main pupils on the roll of schools in Lincolnshire, and includes Gender breakouts. Pupils are allocated to geographical areas (such as Wards and NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups) based on home address.\r\n\r\nFigures shown in the data as \u2018Out of County\u2019 represent pupils not resident within the Lincolnshire administrative boundary. Those are included in the Lincolnshire total.\r\n\r\nData is suppressed where appropriate 5 persons and below (which may be shown as zero or by missing data). That and any unmatched postcodes may mean numbers for small areas might not add up exactly to figures shown for larger areas.\r\n\r\nData is from the Schools Census and shows a snapshot in January and is updated annually.\r\n\r\nData source: Lincolnshire County Council Children's Services.
