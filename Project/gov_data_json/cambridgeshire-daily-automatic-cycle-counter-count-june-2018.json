This data release will form part of a series of open data releases to extract as much insight as possible from the network.</p>\n<p>For full details of the physical location of these counters, please click\u00a0<a href=\"https://data.cambridgeshireinsight.org.uk/dataset/location-automatic-road-traffic-and-cycle-counters-cambridgeshire\">here</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please note that due to the unreliability of the counters as a legacy system, it has not always been possible to extract a daily count for each day. Where it has not been able to extract a count, a blank (-) cell has been included. The data has been reviewed and some counts have been removed due to clear errors in the count, rather than\u00a0 the data given from the counters.</p>\n<p>This dataset only includes the total count over each site and not a breakdown by each channel, The next phase of the release will look to download more detail.</p>\n<p>For any specific queries, please contact\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:research.group@cambridgeshire.gov.uk\">research.group@cambridgeshire.gov.uk</a></p>\n",
