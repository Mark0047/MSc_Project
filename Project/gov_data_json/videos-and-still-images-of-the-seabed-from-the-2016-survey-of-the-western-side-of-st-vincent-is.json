        "notes": "As part of the Commonwealth Marine Economies Programme (CMEP) Cefas collected \n102 drop camera video tows of the seabed off the west coast of St. Vincent \nIsland in the country of St. Vincent and the Grenadines in 2016. These samples \nwere to characterise the benthic fauna within the area and support the \ncreation of benthic habitat maps. The videos and still images were acquired \nusing a lightweight drop camera frame with a SubC camera, two lasers for \nscaling images and additional lighting for real colour images of the seabed. \nThe drop camera frame was lowered to the seabed by hand from a vessel, with \nthe video monitored to maintain a consistent height above the seabed. Tows \nwere 15 minutes long with the vessel drifting in neutral so the distance \ncovered in each tow varied. Sample depths ranged from 5-60 m and covered a \nrange of habitats including bare sediment, seagrass, and coral and sponge \ndominated reefs. Still images were acquired every minute at a point when the \nseabed was clearly in focus.",
