The source of the data is the National Employer Skills Survey (NESS) commissioned by the LSC, DfES and SSDA.  NESS is a large-scale, robust and representative survey of 75,000 employers across England.  Surveys in the series were undertaken in 2003, 2004, and 2005 and are expected to continue every two years.  Data from the 2007 study will be available from November 2007. Data relate to the workforce in the establishment at the time of survey\r\n",
