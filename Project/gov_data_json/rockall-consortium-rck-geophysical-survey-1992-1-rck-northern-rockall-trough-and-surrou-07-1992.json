        "notes": "This marine geophysical survey took place from 03/05/1992 \u2013 10/07/1992 in the Rockall Continental Margin on board the Kommandor Michael. The survey was carried out by the British Geological Survey (BGS). The aim of the survey was to investigate the shallow seismic structure along the eastern margin of the Rockall Bank, Northern Rockall Trough and adjacent banks. Sub bottom seismic profiling data were collected using Airgun, Sparker and Deep Tow Boomer systems. Gravity and Magnetic data were also acquired. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS Technical Report WB/92/20C. Brett, CP and Dobinson, A. 1992. Rockall Continental Margin Project. Operations Report.
