        "notes": "Data for the first prospective year of the National Cataract Audit. The data was collected as part of routine clinical care on electronic medical record systems in 56 participating centres. The three metrics used in the national cataract audit are case ascertainment and adjusted rates for posterior capsular rupture and visual acuity loss. The denominator for case ascertainment was the number of cataract operations reported to NHS digital, 3 centres did not supply this information to NHS digital and 2 centres supplied data for more cataract operations than they reported to NHS digital. Operative data is more consistent than post-operative data as not all centres use the electronic medical record systems in all areas of their hospital eye service. Post-operative results also do not include operations performed in the last 2 months of the audit. Results are provided for contributing NHS Trusts and not for individual sites as this information was not uniformly collected in the first year of the audit. Two centres removed permission for their case complexity adjusted results to be published. The ophthalmology service for Croydon Health Services NHS Trust is now run by Moorefield's Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and these two NHS Trusts have the same ODS code. The results for Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust include patients from Airedale Hospital NHS Foundation Trust as cataract surgery for Airedale patients is performed in Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust sites. \r\n\r\nFor enquiries regarding the National Cataract Audit, see the website (www.nodaudit.org.uk) or email via noa.project@rcophth.ac.uk",
