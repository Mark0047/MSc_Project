The project was a novel programme in which the \ncommercial potting vessel *Providence* was chartered to undertake an \nacoustic seabed survey to assess the character of the seabed using \nstate-of-the-art scientific equipment. This was done to assess whether the \nfishing industry can play a role collecting seabed habitat data to address the \nUK's need for such data by deploying a multibeam echosounder from a fishing \nvessel.",
