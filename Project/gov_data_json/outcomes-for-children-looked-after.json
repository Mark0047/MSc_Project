Some of the more commonly used raw data on children looked after is held in the Department's national pupil database .\r\nThe Secretary of State can share raw data from national pupil database under strict terms and conditions with named bodies and third parties who for the purpose of promoting the education or wellbeing of children in England are conducting research or analysis, producing statistics, or providing information, advice or guidance. This has provided invaluable evidence on education to inform independent research, as well as studies commissioned by the Department.\r\nAccess is subject to requesters complying with terms and conditions imposed under contractual arrangements and a rigorous accreditation process."
