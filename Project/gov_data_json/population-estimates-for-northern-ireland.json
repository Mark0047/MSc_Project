        "notes": "Population estimates relate to the population as of 30th June each year, and therefore are often referred to as mid-year estimates.  They are used to allocate public funds to the Northern Ireland Executive through the [Barnett formula](http://archive.niassembly.gov.uk/finance/2007mandate/research/090320.pdf) and are widely used by Northern Ireland government departments for the planning of services, such as health and education. \r\n\r\nThese statistics are also of interest to those involved in research and academia. They are widely used to express other statistics as a rate, and thus enable comparisons across the United Kingdom and other countries. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, population estimates form the basis for future population statistics such as population projections.",

Digital NI aims to help establish a culture within Northern Ireland that develops and enhances Digital capability not just through interactions with Government, but also with local companies and throughout communities. Within government the Digital Transformation Service is facilitating this cultural shift through a number of methods, transforming Government services, making data open and available and encouraging and coaching those who lack digital skills.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that opening up our data is the right thing to do in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the Public Sector in Northern Ireland. It has the potential to encourage new commercial opportunities and drive economic growth and innovation across public and private sectors.",
