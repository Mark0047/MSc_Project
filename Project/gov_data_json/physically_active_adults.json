This measure is a crude proportion and no age-standardisation has been applied to the results to adjust for differences in age structure between areas. It is likely that a greater proportion of younger people undertake levels of physical activity at the recommended levels than older people. Sport England numerator data are based on observed self-reported physical activity levels in the previous 4 weeks and self-reported physical activity levels may be prone to respondent bias. In addition, the indicator does not include active recreation such as housework, DIY, activity in ones job or active transport. Confidence intervals apply.",
