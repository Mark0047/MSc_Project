Digital NI aims to help establish a culture within Northern Ireland that develops and enhances Digital capability not just through interactions with Government, but also with local companies and throughout communities. Within government the Digital Transformation Service is facilitating this cultural shift through a number of methods, transforming Government services, making data open and available and encouraging and coaching those who lack digital skills.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that opening up our data is the right thing to do in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the Public Sector in Northern Ireland. It has the potential to encourage new commercial opportunities and drive economic growth and innovation across public and private sectors.",

Some information has been redacted from the dataset held on the portal in line with data protection regulations.  This includes: \r\n\r\nPersonal information, such as individual\u2019s names and addresses; \r\nProjects that Invest NI plans to announce publicly on a future date, as early disclosure may result in detriment to the customer or Invest NI; and \r\nCommercially sensitive information, including the number of jobs created by individual projects while a project is still live as this would give a competitor insight into a business\u2019 performance. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the tables contained in this workbook aggregate both the published and redacted data to provide the reader with a full picture of Invest NI support.  The data has also been broken down into several different variables to provide information on:\r\n\r\nOwnership / Country - where Invest NI customers offered support originate from;\r\nInward Investment - investment secured from outside NI by type of support (new to NI or existing investor);\r\nGeography - where customers are located in Northern Ireland (council and constituency);\r\nSector - which industrial sector customers operate in (based on Standard Industrial Classification (SIC Code); and\r\nType of Support - what type of business development activity is being supported.",
