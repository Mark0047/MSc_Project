Environmental waters are designated as sensitive areas where they are in need of protection through the provision of tertiary treatment at sewage treatment plants whose discharges adversely impact the waters.  There are various types of sensitive areas and their type will influence the form of tertiary treatment provided: for example bathing and shellfish waters sensitive areas will be protected by UV treatment, and waters adversely affected by nutrients in discharges will receive phosphorus and/or nitrogen reduction. \r\n",
