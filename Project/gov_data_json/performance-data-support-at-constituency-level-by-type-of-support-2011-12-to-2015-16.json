Digital NI aims to help establish a culture within Northern Ireland that develops and enhances Digital capability not just through interactions with Government, but also with local companies and throughout communities. Within government the Digital Transformation Service is facilitating this cultural shift through a number of methods, transforming Government services, making data open and available and encouraging and coaching those who lack digital skills.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that opening up our data is the right thing to do in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the Public Sector in Northern Ireland. It has the potential to encourage new commercial opportunities and drive economic growth and innovation across public and private sectors.",

This money is only paid when a business can demonstrate it has met the conditions of our offer \u2013 e.g. when jobs are actually in place. In some cases businesses may not receive all the money we offer. \r\nTotal Investment includes Invest NI support.\r\nFigures include both projects that are specifically aimed at job creation and projects that are not; therefore, job numbers do not directly correlate with the assistance and investment figures.\r\nInvest NI revises performance data on a regular basis to ensure that it reflects implemented projects; therefore, the data above may differ to previously "
