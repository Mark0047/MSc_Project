This typically represents 11 year olds at KS2 and 14 year olds at KS3. The figures reported are based on teacher assessments. The teacher assessments measure pupils' attainment against the levels set by the National Curriculum in the whole subject over the academic year. They measure the extent to which pupils have the specific knowledge, skills and understanding which the National Curriculum expects pupils to have mastered by the end of the Key Stage. The National Curriculum standards have been designed so that most pupils will progress by approximately one level every two years. This means that by the end of KS2, pupils are expected to reach Level 4. When presenting analyses that refer to expected level at Key Stage 3, the Department's practice is to measure against those pupils achieving Level 5 or above.\r\n\r\nSource: Department for Children Schools and Families (DCSF)\r\n\r\nPublisher: Department for Children Schools and Families (DCSF)\r\n\r\nGeographies: County/Unitary Authority, Government Office Region (GOR), National\r\n\r\nGeographic coverage: England\r\n\r\nTime coverage: 2009\r\n\r\nType of data: Administrative data",
