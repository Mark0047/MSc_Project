        "notes": "A dataset of airborne particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) readings (every 3 minutes) collected by participating households in Northeast England in their kitchens and living rooms over the course of one week, along with data from a linked questionnaire survey and metal(oid)s data from a corresponding household vacuum dust sample collected by the study participant. Matched air monitoring and dust sample collection took place between June 2020 and August 2021. We increasingly spend time indoors and household air pollution results in an estimated 4.25 million premature deaths globally each year. The majority of these deaths are associated with fine particulate matter (PM), or dust. Exposure to PM can initiate or enhance disease in humans, yet the nature of the hazard that house dust presents remains poorly characterized. The data was collected to provide concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 in a range of Northeast England households and concentrations of metal(oid)s in their house dust. It will be of interest to those interested in human exposure to potentially toxic elements and environmental health. We used factory calibrated Aeroqual 500 units for PM monitoring. Metal(oid)s data were generated using a SPECTROSCOUT X-Ray fluorescence spectrometer on the <250um sieved fraction of household vacuum dust. This dataset was part of NERC Grant NE/T004401/1.",
