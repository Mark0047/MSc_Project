        "notes": "[THIS DATASET HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN]. This dataset includes vegetation chemistry data from the experimental plots at the Climoor field site in the Clocaenog Forest, NE Wales. It also includes data from material collected from outside, but nearby, the experimental plots. Both green and naturally senesced material was analysed between 1998 and 2010 (although not every year was included within this period). Where green material was analysed, only the current years growth was included in the sample. The dataset also includes analysis of different parts of the plants at the site, for example, Calluna vulgaris stems, Calluna vulgaris leaves. Plant species include Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum, Deschampsia flexuosa, Pleurozium schreberi. Determinants include carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose and carbohydrates. Full details about this dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5285/0e8a3212-3b7a-40b4-890b-4f6565aca87a",
