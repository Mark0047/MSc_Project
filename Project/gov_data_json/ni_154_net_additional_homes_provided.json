The net increase in dwelling stock over one year is calculated as the sum of new build completions, minus demolitions, plus any gains or losses at the same address.\r\nSource: Communities and Local Government (CLG)\r\nPublisher: DCLG Floor Targets Interactive\r\nGeographies: Local Authority District (LAD), County/Unitary Authority, Government Office Region (GOR), National\r\nGeographic coverage: England\r\nTime coverage: 2006/07 to 2007/08\r\nNotes: The definition of dwelling (in line with the 2001 Census) is a self-contained unit of accommodation. Self-containment is where all the rooms in a household are behind a door, which only that household can use. Non-self contained household spaces at the same address should be counted together as a single dwelling. Therefore, a dwelling can consist of one self-contained household space or two or more non-self-contained spaces at the same address.\r\nGuidelines: Good performance is typified by an increase in numbers of net additional homes.",
