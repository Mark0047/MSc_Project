        "notes": "The Intensified Official Control (IOC) check system is intended to improve the safety of imported foods into GB. IOC checks are applied when import checks already undertaken show that legislation has been seriously or repeatedly breached. The additional import checks are implemented to provide stronger assurance that food is safe when entering GB market. The checks are normally applied only to the specific establishment where there are concerns for public health.\r\n\r\nIf there are unfavourable failures during the Intensified Official Control period, the issue will be escalated Imposed Checks (IC). Products under IC will have additional safeguard measures in place. Current IOC that has escalated to IC is highlighted under Current Status.",
