        "notes": "These data are tree ring width series collected from increment cores taken from oak trees in the New Forest, Thetford Forest and Peninsula (Somerset, Devon and Cornwall) regions. The aim of this work was to investigate differences in growth and responses to climate in oak trees across these regions. All sites were in productive managed forests. All sites were stands of pure oak, except UK01, UK02, UK06, UK07, UK15, UK17, UK19, UK22 which were an intimate mixture of oak and Scots pine. These data were collected as part of the MULTIFOR: Management of Multi-Functional Forests project financed by the Forestry Commission with matched funding provided by the European Union (European Regional Development Fund ERDF) within the framework of the European INTERREG IV A 2 Mers Seas Zee\u00ebn Cross-border Cooperation Programme 2007-2013 (Project 090316 016-FR) under the priority to: 'Ensure a sustainable environmental development of the common space'; with the objective to 'Ensure a balanced management of the environment and raise awareness about environmental issues'. \nSee also: Barsoum, N., Eaton, E.L., Levani\u010d, T., Pargade, J., Bonnart, X. and Morison, J.I.L., 2015.
