        "notes": "**Welcome to the City Data Strategy for London**.\n\nThis document is built around the following vision:  \n_We want London to have the most dynamic and productive City Data Market in the world. In our City_  \n_Data Market, the capabilities, talents and capacity of all our city data partners will impact on our huge_  \n_social, economic and service-based challenges. To make this happen, friction in the sharing and_  \n_value-driven exploitation of city data will be reduced to a minimum. City data will be recognised as_  \n_part of the capital\u2019s infrastructure. We will use it to save money, incubate innovation and drive_  \n_economic growth. And London will achieve global renown for data impact._\n\n  \nWe will of course use this strategy in support of City Hall initiatives like the Smart London Plan, but  \nwe acknowledge at the outset that the Greater London Authority simply cannot deliver this strategy  \non its own. Indeed, data knows no boundaries and is hard to contain, so we should not try. Our  \nsimple aim is to make sure that London, its economy and its communities are able to derive maximum  \nbenefit from the undoubted potential London\u2019s Data Market can deliver.\n\n  \nIt therefore signals the start of a plan which will actively integrate and mobilise all the \u2018working parts\u2019  \nof the city data economy. We want the various audiences that the Strategy is aimed at to engage with  \nit. We will listen and evolve the strategy as this rapidly developing part of the cityscape develops.",
