        "notes": "This dataset shows the 2011 Census Output Areas (OAs) \u2013 Part Removed.  This dataset contains the polygons which were removed in order to make the OA whole. The area of these polygons is included in the area figure for the 2011 OA. \n\nThere were 349 non contiguous census output areas not caused by water.   A decision was made to delete one of the polygons to make the OA whole.  \n\nThis was purely a cosmetic exercise.  The part to be removed did not contain the master postcode and in the majority of the cases it was the smaller of the polygons but in a few instances it may  have been the  large part simply because the smaller part was more dense and master postcode assigned to it.  \n\nRevisions and Corrections\n\nRevision to 2011 Output Area codes (13 September 2013)\nAn anomaly was discovered in the 2011 Census Output Area (OA) codes which were published on 15 August 2013.  The anomaly meant that, whilst all the current 2011 Census OA codes were unique, they did not always run in sequential order by council area. We decided to replace the codes with new ones that start at S00088956 and end with S00135306.\nCorrection to 2011 Output Area boundaries (7 October 2013)\nTen boundaries have been added to the dataset following amendments in line with the cosmetic exercise/spatial improvement described earlier",
