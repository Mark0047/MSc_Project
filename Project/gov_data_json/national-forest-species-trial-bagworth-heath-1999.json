        "notes": "A series of species trials were set up to investigate the establishment and early growth (up to 14 years old) of 44 native and non-native tree species on a variety of different site types in lowland Britain.\nOn good quality lowland afforestation sites, Platanus x hispanica (London plane) established and grew more successfully than the native trees tested, and may be an example of a species that could\ntheoretically be established in anticipation of future climate change. Experiments on a variety of community woodland sites indicated that a range of exotic species, such as X Cupressocyparis\nleylandii (Leyland cypress), may have the potential for establishing a woodland cover on poorly restored land where few other trees would grow. However, on less challenging, better restored sites,\na wide range of native species also grew successfully. Further long-term and larger scale trials on a wider variety of sites are required to confirm the potential of the species tested for British conditions.\nThe results from these experiments also showed that relative growth rates of different species can vary through time, highlighting the danger in making premature judgements about species\nsuitability based solely on very early tree growth.\nSee also: Willoughby, I., Stokes, V., Poole, J., White, J.E.J. and Hodge, S.J.
