As \u2018work-in-progress', they may not meet rigorous quality standards. They have been released because they have been judged to be of immediate value to interested parties and in order to encourage user feedback.\r\n\r\nThe release covers certificates lodged between 2008 and Q4, 2015, and breaks the data down for each specified calendar quarter (Q1=Jan-Mar, Q2=Apr-Jun, Q3=Jul-Sep, Q4=Oct-Dec) within each specified calendar year. The Q4 2015 figures will also change in subsequent quarterly publications as the EPB Registers are updated with new EPCs and DECs.\r\n\r\nEnergy assessor accreditation schemes originally had the choice of lodging the underlying data used to produce domestic EPCs, in addition to the actual PDF document itself. After September 2008, lodging the data became a mandatory requirement. Due to the technical difficulty involved in formatting PDFs into searchable data, the statistics do not include data lodged as a PDF document only.\r\n\r\nThese statistics cover certificates on the energy efficiency of domestic and non-domestic buildings in England and Wales that have been constructed, sold, or let since 2008, and of larger public authority buildings since 2008. These statistics, therefore, do not cover the entire building stock across England and Wales but should be viewed as part of a wider package of Government\u2019s provision of information on the energy efficiency of buildings.\r\n\r\nThis data is also available in Table LA1, available for download as an [MS Excel Spreadsheet](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/495421/Table_LA1.xlsx).\r\n\r\nMore details about regulatory context and data quality can be found [here](https://www.gov.uk/energy-performance-of-buildings-certificates-notes-and-definitions).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
