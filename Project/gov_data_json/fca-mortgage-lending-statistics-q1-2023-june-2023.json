        "notes": "The FCA and the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) both have responsibility for the regulation of mortgage lenders and administrators. They jointly publish the mortgage lending statistics every quarter.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of 2007, around 340 regulated mortgage lenders and administrators have been required to submit a Mortgage Lending and Administration Return (MLAR) each quarter, providing data on their mortgage lending activities.\r\n\r\n##Latest findings\r\n* The outstanding value of all residential mortgage loans was \u00a31,675.4 billion at the end of 2023 Q1, 2.7% higher than a year earlier, but a decrease on the previous quarter for the first time since 2017 Q2.\r\n \r\n* The value of gross mortgage advances in 2023 Q1 was \u00a358.8 billion, which was \u00a322.9 billion lower than the previous quarter, and 23.6% lower than in 2022 Q1. This was the lowest observed since 2020 Q2.\r\n \r\n* The value of new mortgage commitments (lending agreed to be advanced in the coming months) in 2023 Q1 was 16.1% less than the previous quarter and 40.7% less than a year earlier, at \u00a348.9 billion. This was also the lowest observed since 2020 Q2.",
