        "notes": "The survey describes the range of sublittoral habitats and populations of plants and animals present around Ramsey Island and the offshore rocks. Systematic survey sites were located on Ordnance Survey grid intercepts of the coast and at selected sites. Stations were placed at depths below Chart Datum of 0,2,5,7.5,10,12.5,15 and 20 m along each survey line. In addition descriptive surveys were carried out by spot dives, drift dives and with a towed sledge. 115 stations at 18 sites were surveyed. The substrate present around Ramsey were found to be predominantly of clean stable rock. There was a marked zonation of species with depth and different populations were found on the west and east side of the island due to wave and tide exposure differences. Several species of algae and animals at or near the northern limits of their recorded distributions or of special interest because of their rarity were recorded. Full species lists are given for the sites surveyed in addition to substrate and habitat data. Records currently considered sensitive have been removed from this dataset.",
