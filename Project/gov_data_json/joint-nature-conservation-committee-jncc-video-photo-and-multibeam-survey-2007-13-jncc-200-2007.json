        "notes": "Mid Irish Sea reefs Survey (2006-2007). The aim of this survey was to improve understanding of the habitats and communities present in an area of the Irish Sea identified as potentially containing Annex I reef habitat according to the Habitats Directive. Survey cruises were undertaken in November 2006 (Multibeam), January 2007 (Sampling) and March 2007 (Sampling) onboard Research Vessel Aora, with specialists from the National Oceanography Centre (NOC), ERT (Scotland) Ltd (ERT), University Marine Biological Station and Seatronics Ltd. Data collected included multibeam, drop down video and stills camera images. Defra Natural Environmental Group Science Division (CRO 361) made a significant financial contribution to this work. Joint \u00a9 2006 Defra, JNCC and ERT (Scotland) Ltd. The geology component of the data is archived at the British Geological Survey (BGS) MEDIN Data Archive Centre (DAC) for Geology and Geophysics. Biological and bathymetry data are archived at DASSH and UKHO respectively. For more information see http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-4735, JNCC Report 411: http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-4518.",
