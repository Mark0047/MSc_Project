        "notes": "This dataset consists of analysed phytoplankton data from the years 2018-2019 \ninclusive collected in UK waters from the SmartBuoy moorings at Dowsing, \nWestGabbard2, Warp and Liverpool Bay using WMS and EDU automated water \nsamplers. SmartBuoys consist of a 4 meter tall stainless steel frame with a \nfibreglass toroid for buoyancy. Instruments are attached at a nominal 1 meter \ndepth to the frame. The water samplers collect into pre-spiked bags containing \nacidified Lugols Iodine on a pre-determined cycle over the course of a \ndeployment. As of the beginning of this data set water samples have been taken \nusing a CTD rosette on mooring turnarounds in case of buoy failure, reducing \nthe issue of data gaps Following recovery these samples were analysed for a \nfull community of phytoplankton species using the Utermohl method on \nhigh-power inverted microscopes. Phytoplankton cell counts are abundance \nvalues reported in Cells per Litre.",
