        "notes": "Monitor is publishing the information from the 2014/15 Foundation Trust Consolidation (FTC) files submitted to Monitor by NHS foundation trusts on 29 May 2015. \r\n\r\nThese files contain NHS foundation trusts\u2019 accounts data and related information for 2014/15. The data published here is limited to the information that NHS foundation trusts are required to include in their annual accounts. \r\n\r\nThe information is already available in individual NHS foundation trusts\u2019 annual reports as laid before Parliament and published by Monitor on its website. The intention of this data file is to make this data easier to locate and manipulate. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this file does not contain consolidation adjustments made by Monitor, such as adjustments Monitor makes to eliminate income and expenditure between NHS foundation trusts. For this reason. the totals of the data included in this file might not agree with Monitor\u2019s consolidated NHS foundation trust accounts. Please also note that from 2013/14 this data includes the results of NHS charitable funds where the foundation trust has assessed that it can control the charity as defined by accounting standards. \r\n\r\nThree files have been published, which should be used in conjunction: \r\n\r\n\u2022 the data file, containing all of the FTC data published in the accounts of the 153 NHS foundation trusts in existence during the 2014/15 financial year; \r\n\r\n\u2022 an instructions document; and \r\n\r\n\u2022 an illustrative FTC file to assist the user in locating understanding the data being presented. \r\n\r\nThe data set is a large file which contains tables of accounts data, for all notes to the accounts, for multiple NHS foundation trusts. It is difficult to present this data in a better format given the multi-dimensional nature of the data and limitations on file size. To assist the user in manipulating this data, please refer to the instructions document for further guidance. \r\n",
