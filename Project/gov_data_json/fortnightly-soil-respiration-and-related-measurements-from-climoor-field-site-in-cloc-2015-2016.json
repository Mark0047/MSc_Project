        "notes": "The data resource comprises of two datasets. The first dataset comprises of fortnightly measurements soil respiration, soil temperature, soil moisture and photosynthetic activity. The second data set comprises of fortnightly measurements of rainfall, throughfall and water table depth. Data were collected from the climate change field site Climoor that is located in Clocaenog forest, Northeast Wales during 2015 and 2016. The experimental field site consists of three untreated control plots, three plots where the plant canopy air is artificially warmed during night time hours and three plots where rainfall is excluded from the plots at least during the plants growing season (March to September,) All measurements of this dataset have been carried out every fortnight if not indicated otherwise. Rainfall in millimetres (mm) was measured at the site using a ground-level rain gauge. Rain throughfall (in mm) was measured in each plot using a funnel-bottle construction to collect rain water in the plant canopy. Water table depth was measured for each plot using a measuring tape. Soil respiration and related soil temperature and soil moisture were measured in three areas of each plot. Soil respiration was measured in pre-installed opaque soil collars (20 centimetre diameter) that were installed in 1999. An infra-red gas analyser (EGM-4) was used. Photosynthetic active radiation was measured above the canopy while the soil respiration measurement was conducted. The measurements were carried out by different groups of CEH Bangor staff. The Climoor field experiment intends to answer questions regarding the effects of warming and drought on ecosystem processes. Plot level soil respiration measurements are important to investigate soil carbon dynamics and changes in soil carbon cycling and storage under the imposed climatic treatments. More detailed information about the field site, measurements and related datasets can be found in the supporting documentation. Soil respiration data for 1999-2015 are available from https://doi.org/10.5285/4ed6f721-b23b-454e-b185-02ba54d551f0 Full details about this dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5285/9df4ca6b-6c24-44f9-be25-0bd97ff9594e",
