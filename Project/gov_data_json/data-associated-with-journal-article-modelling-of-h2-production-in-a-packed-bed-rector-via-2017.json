The sorption enhanced steam reforming (SE-SMR) of methane over the surface of 18 wt. % Ni/Al2O3 catalyst and using CaO as a CO2-sorbent is simulated for an adiabatic packed bed reactor. The developed model accounts for all the aspects of mass and energy transfer, in both gas and solid phase along the axial direction of the reactor. The process was studied under temperature and pressure conditions used in industrial SMR operations. The simulation results were compared with equilibrium calculations and modelling data from literature. A good agreement was obtained in terms of CH4 conversion, hydrogen yield (wt. % of CH4 feed), purity of H2 and CO2 capture under the different operation conditions such as temperature, pressure, steam to carbon ratio (S/C) and gas mass flux. A pressure of 30 bar, 923 K and S/C of 3 can result in CH4 conversion and H2 purity up to 65% and 85% respectively compared to 24% and 49% in the conventional process.",
