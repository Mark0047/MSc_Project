        "notes": "[THIS DATASET HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN]. This data set comprises of weekly water quality monitoring data of seven sites along the River Thames, UK, and fifteen of its major tributaries from February 2009 to February 2013. Parameters measured were phosphorus and nitrogen species, dissolved reactive silicon, water temperature, pH, Gran alkalinity, suspended solids, chlorophyll and major dissolved anions (fluoride, chloride, bromide, sulphate) and cations (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, boron). Dissolved and total iron, manganese, zinc, copper concentrations have also been produced from August 2010 to February 2013. The accompanying daily river flow data are also supplied. Samples were taken as part of the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology's Thames Initiative monitoring programme. Full details about this dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5285/e4c300b1-8bc3-4df2-b23a-e72e67eef2fd",
