        "notes": "The Mayor of London is committed to reducing emissions and addressing the climate emergency. As part of this, the Mayor is driving forward an ambitious plan to make the city Net Zero-Carbon by 2030 and expects GLA funded training providers to have a Net Zero-Carbon plan in place by 2024.\n\nTo help providers meet this expectation, the Mayor launched a Net Zero- Carbon toolkit in November 2023, providing best practice and guidance. Building on this work, the GLA has commissioned a report, led by the Carbon Trust and Alliance for Sustainability Leadership in Education EAUC. This report estimates the potential cost and skills required for FE colleges to achieve Net Zero-Carbon by 2030.\n\nWhilst highlighting opportunities for the government to work more closely with the Mayor on this agenda, the report estimates that decarbonising London\u2019s FE estates could cost between \u00a3213-279 million.",
