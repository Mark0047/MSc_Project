Therefore, emissions from the production of goods which are exported will be included, and emissions from the production of goods which are imported are excluded.\r\n\r\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is the main greenhouse gas, accounting for about 82 per cent of the UK greenhouse gas emissions in 2014. In recent years, increasing emphasis has been placed on the role of regional bodies and local government in contributing to energy efficiency improvements, and hence reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. The statistics are largely consistent with the UK national Greenhouse Gas Inventory and with the Devolved Administration Greenhouse Gas Inventories, but there are some minor methodological differences outlined in the methodology report.\r\n",
