This can be found here: https://data.gov.uk/catalog/data-sets/59af775e-efc7-458b-bdc3-593651d08aa8/association-of-drainage-authorities-administrative-boundaries-internal-drainage-districts-in-england\n\nInternal Drainage Boards (IDBs) are independent locally funded and operated statutory public bodies. There are currently around 100 IDBs in England and the Boards consist of elected members who represent agricultural rate payers and local authority appointed members representing special levy payers in the local community.\n\nIDBs are responsible for water level management in areas of special drainage need. They are responsible for reducing flood risk from ordinary watercourses for both rural and urban communities (including protection of businesses and infrastructure) and they also have duties in protecting and enhancing valuable wildlife habitats and conservation.  \n\nThey work in close partnership with the Environment Agency, Natural England, local authorities and others in carrying out their duties. \n\nFor further information please visit: http://www.ada.org.uk/about_idbs.html",
