This year we have focussed on how hospitals can use make the most of their data to improve care through Quality Improvement. We encourage you to look at our new Quarterly Governance Tool to identify areas of improvement.\r\n\r\nThe annual report encompasses the whole of 2020 and 2021, to demonstrate how care compares with that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. It builds on the detailed analysis of our six Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in last year\u2019s report, and seeks to look forward with innovations including new KPIs designed to examine the very first and final stages of each patient\u2019s care pathway.",
