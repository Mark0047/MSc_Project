        "notes": "The 1km Hex Mining Hazard (Not Including Coal) v7 dataset shows areas of known underground mining (Not Including Coal), identified with an indication of the level of hazard associated for each site. The presence of former underground workings, particularly where shallow, may collapse and cause surface settlement which is used to identify potential hazard at each site. The rating is based on a Low (limited mining known to have occurred) to High (underground mining is known to have occurred) scale. The dataset covers areas of known underground working in Great Britain. The coverage is not comprehensive as areas with no evidence of underground working are unclassified. Underground extraction of minerals and rocks has taken place in Great Britain for more than 5000 years. This dataset draws together a range of diverse information; the geology, the primary constraint on distribution; additional information sourced from published literature and knowledge from BGS experts. Derived from the original MiningHazardNotIncludingCoalGB_v7 dataset, this layer generalises these data into a Hex grid format, with an effective hexagonal grid resolution of 2.6km coverage area (side length of 1km). The dataset was created to provide a comprehensive overview of Great Britain's long and complicated mining legacy. It provides essential information for planners and developers working in areas where former underground mine workings may have occurred. Also for anyone involved in the ownership or management of property, including developers, householders and local government.",
