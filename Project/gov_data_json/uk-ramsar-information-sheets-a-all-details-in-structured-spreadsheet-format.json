        "notes": "Ramsar sites are wetlands of international importance designated under the Ramsar Convention.  This spreadsheet contains all of the information within Ramsar Information Sheets for all designated Ramsar sites within the UK and its Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies. The information in the spreadsheet is in a structured format to facilitate data analysis\n\nThe spreadsheet contains the following tabs:\n\n* SiteData \u00e2\u0080\u0093 summary information about the Ramsar sites themselves. Including a brief description, size, location, date of designation, reasons for designation, information on flora and fauna and a site-relevant bibliography. Most of the data are sourced from the Ramsar Information Sheet. The SiteData list includes all designated Ramsar sites in the UK and its Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies. \n\n* BirdData \u00e2\u0080\u0093 shows the occurrence of each bird species on each site within the UK. The list of species for each site includes only those species listed on the Ramsar Information Sheet. Bird species occurring on Ramsar sites in UK Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies can be found in the SiteData tab. Note that some Ramsar sites do not support significant bird interest. \n\n* Ramsar maps \u00e2\u0080\u0093 offer a simple mapping facility. If a particular feature or site is selected in the above worksheets using the Autofilter function, a dot map will be displayed showing the location of the site(s).\n\n* Criteria \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a list of criteria for which each site was designated. See Annex II of the Ramsar Secretariat's Explanatory Notes and Guidelines for the Criteria and guidelines for their application. \n\n* Physical data \u00e2\u0080\u0093 summary information on landscape, geomorphology, geology and soils. It is intended to give a general impression of the physical character of the Ramsar site and is not a detailed description. Note that some characteristics listed may form only a minor component of the site. This information is sourced from the Ramsar Information Sheet. \n\n* Habitat cover \u00e2\u0080\u0093 indicates the percentage cover of certain broad habitat types within each Ramsar site. These are intended to give a general impression of the character of the site. The habitat types are defined by the Ramsar Information Sheet. \n\n* Wet types \u00e2\u0080\u0093 broad information on the type of wetland within each Ramsar site such as inland wetland, marine/coastal wetland and man-made (artificial) wetland. It is intended to give a general impression of the physical character of the Ramsar site and is not a detailed description. Note that more than one wetland type may occur in a single site. This information is sourced from the Ramsar Information Sheet. \n\n* Adverse factors \u00e2\u0080\u0093 summary information on significant natural or human-caused factors which have adversely affected Ramsar sites and any measures being taken to address these issues as reported to the Ramsar Secretariat. This information is sourced from the latest Ramsar UK National Report. Note that some minor factors may not be listed. The worksheet also includes Adverse factors reported previously but which are not considered to be operating at present or which have been addressed effectively. This information is mainly sourced from the previous Ramsar UK National Report to the 9th Conference of Parties.    \n\n* Human factors \u00e2\u0080\u0093 summary information on factors such as land tenure/ownership, Current land use & human activities, social & cultural values and conservation measures taken on or adjacent to each Ramsar site. This information is sourced from the Ramsar Information Sheet. Note that some minor factors may not be listed.",
