Digital NI aims to help establish a culture within Northern Ireland that develops and enhances Digital capability not just through interactions with Government, but also with local companies and throughout communities. Within government the Digital Transformation Service is facilitating this cultural shift through a number of methods, transforming Government services, making data open and available and encouraging and coaching those who lack digital skills.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that opening up our data is the right thing to do in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the Public Sector in Northern Ireland. It has the potential to encourage new commercial opportunities and drive economic growth and innovation across public and private sectors.",

It includes the charities' names, contacts, charitable purposes, finances, beneficiaries, and charity trustees.\r\n\r\nAn organisation must apply for registration as a charity in Northern Ireland, regardless of its income, size or whether or not it has received charitable tax status from HMRC, if:\r\n\r\n* it is governed by the law of Northern Ireland, and\r\n* it has exclusively charitable purposes\r\n* it is an institution, that is, it is an organisation that is an independent body, the hallmarks of which include having control and direction over its governance and resources.\r\n\r\nThe Register of Charities contains details of registered charities and information from their Annual Monitoring Returns (AMRs).\r\n\r\nAt present, the Commission is managing registration in stages, only organisations which have been called forward by the Commission are eligible to register as a charity.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that annual reporting to the Commission applies only to full financial periods following registration and that a charity has a deadline of 10 months following the end of each financial period within which to submit its annual accounts and reports.  This means that, at present, the income data on the Register of Charities is limited. As more charities fall due to submit their annual accounts and reports more information will become available.\r\n\r\nFor more information on charity registration, visit the Commission's website.",
