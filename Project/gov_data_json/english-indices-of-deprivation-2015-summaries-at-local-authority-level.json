At the time of publication, there were 326 local authority districts in England.\r\n\r\nSummary measures are provided for each of the Index of Multiple \r\nDeprivation (IMD), the seven domains and the supplementary indices of income deprivation among children and older people.\r\n\r\nThe data for each summary measure are presented in pairs of scores and ranks:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe first variable in each pair (e.g. \u2018average rank\u2019) is the score for the measure. The higher the score, the more deprived the area. \r\n\u2022\tThe second variable in each pair (e.g. \u2018rank of average rank\u2019) is the rank for the measure. On each measure, the local authority district with a rank of 1 is the most deprived, and the area ranked 326 is the least deprived.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about how to interpret these measures in section 3.3 of the Research Report, and how they were calculated in section 3.8 of the Technical Report available at: www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2015.
