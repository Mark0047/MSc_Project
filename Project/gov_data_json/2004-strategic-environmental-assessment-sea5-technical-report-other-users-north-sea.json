The SEA 5 area covers parts of the central and northern North Sea to the east of the Scottish mainland, Orkney and Shetland. The area supports different users and activities, many of which are focussed in particular coastal and marine areas. This report presents an initial overview of the coastal population of the SEA 5 area and the industries and activities which utilise the SEA 5 area including: Oil and gas activity; Commercial fishing; Fisheries for migratory species; Ports and shipping; Mariculture; Military activity; Telecommunication cables; Renewable energy; Aggregate extraction; Marine disposal; Tourism and leisure; Locally important activities; Coastal and marine archaeology; Coastal and marine management initiatives",
