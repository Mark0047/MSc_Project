The survey will also include contextual questions covering, for example, the quality of funding relationships and partnership working between the third sector and local statutory bodies. This will give local authorities more information to understand what may be driving their performance against the headline indicator.\r\nSource: Cabinet Office (CO)\r\nPublisher: DCLG Floor Targets Interactive\r\nGeographies: Local Authority District (LAD), Government Office Region (GOR), National\r\nGeographic coverage: England\r\nTime coverage: 2008\r\nType of data: Survey\r\nNotes: Third sector organisations include voluntary and community organisations, charities, social enterprises, cooperatives and mutuals. These are non-governmental organisations which are value-driven and which principally reinvest their surpluses to further social, environmental or cultural objectives.\r\nGuidelines: Good performance is typified by a higher percentage.",
