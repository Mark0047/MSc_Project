        "notes": "This data is a national historic landfill dataset that defines the location of and provides specific attributes for known historic landfill sites. An historic landfill is a site where there is no environmental permit in force. The Environment Agency is not the regulator for historic landfills. The dataset includes sites that existed before landfills were regulated. Much of this pre-licensing data was derived from a national survey in the early 1990s so it may be incomplete. It also includes sites that were licensed (permitted) where that licence is no longer in force, in accordance with the legislation at the time. The Historic Landfill dataset includes information that is held by either the local authority or the Environment Agency. The data is available in ESRI shape file format, with the boundaries digitised from a base scale of 1:10,000 and an associated attribute table comprising 34 fields. Where information is available, the polygons and attributes describe where the sites were located, when they were used, who used them and what was deposited. Where sites were licensed, there are name and address fields, licensee and operator information, licence issue and surrender dates, first and last input dates and waste types, together with some historical comments. Where an attribute is incomplete, that detail is not available. Attribution statement: \u00a9 Environment Agency copyright and/or database right 2018.
