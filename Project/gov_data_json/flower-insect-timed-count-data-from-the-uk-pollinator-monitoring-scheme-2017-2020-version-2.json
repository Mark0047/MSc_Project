        "notes": "This dataset contains information on the location of the count, some environmental variables, and the number of insects of each type counted for the Flower-Insect Timed Count survey as part of the UK Pollinator Monitoring Scheme (PoMS). It covers the years 2017 to 2020 (note that 2017 was a pilot year and has less data than subsequent years). This is version 2 of the dataset; the previous version contained some duplicate data rows, which have been deduplicated in version 2. The \u201cpublic\u201d FIT Count asks volunteer citizen scientists to count the number of insects, identified into broad taxon groups, seen landing on the flowers of a particular target plant within a 50 cm \u00d7 50 cm quadrat during a period of ten minutes. The \u201c1 km square\u201d FIT Count uses the same methodology, but is carried out by PoMS volunteers and staff as part of the PoMS 1 km square survey, which takes place within a randomly allocated set of 1 km squares in England, Scotland and Wales, and also gathers data on pan-trapped insects (see separate dataset). The UK Pollinator Monitoring Scheme is a partnership between the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Bumblebee Conservation Trust, Butterfly Conservation, British Trust for Ornithology, Hymettus, Natural History Museum, University of Reading and University of Leeds, working with the Bees, Wasps and Ants Recording Society, wider stakeholders and volunteer networks. PoMS is jointly funded by Defra, the Welsh and Scottish Governments, JNCC and project partners.
