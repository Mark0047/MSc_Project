        "notes": "This report is a contribution to the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA7) conducted by the Department of Trade and Industry (now Department of Energy and Climate Change).The purpose of this report is to provide an initial assessment of what is termed the Other Users of the SEA 7 area. These other users include those significant human activities and infrastructure occurring in the marine  and coastal zone, and not addressed by other SEA 7 data reports. Fisheries and maritime archaeology (wrecks) are therefore excluded. The report summarises current activity in the area, and where possible discusses likely future trends. It also summarises the relevance of each activity to any future proposed oil and gas activity. Where appropriate, comment is made about the potential sensitivity of an Other User to oil and gas development, or the potential restrictions to oil and gas development presented by existing users.",
