        "notes": "[This dataset is embargoed until July 1, 2025]. This dataset contains information about the compound-specific stable hydrogen isotope composition (\u03b42H) of n-alkanoic acids with 26, 28 and 30 carbon atoms. The samples originated from the Lake Suigetsu sediment cores. Data is provided at an approximately ~60 year resolution from 132.7 ka BP to 125.2 ka BP (n = 60). To accompany this data, the mass-normalised concentrations of key n-alkane and n-alkanoic acids are provided, alongside n-alkane index values. This data was collected to infer changes to the Lake Suigetsu catchment and the East Asian Summer Monsoon during Glacial Termination II. This work was supported by the Quaternary Research Association, the Scottish Alliance for Geoscience, Environment and Society, the School of Geographical and Earth Science (University of Glasgow) and the NERC IAPETUS2 Doctoral Training Partnership.
