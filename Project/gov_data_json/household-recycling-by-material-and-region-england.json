Maintained to cover a unique temporal range.\r\n\r\nA range of data sources are used to collect the data, including administrative sources and surveys.\r\n\r\nFrom 2002/03 onwards tonnages include recycling collected by private and voluntary schemes.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe tonnages from 1995/96 to 2003/04 are waste collected for recycling, not sent for recycling.  These tonnages will include waste which is later rejected at the gate of the reprocessor.  From 2005/06 onwards the tonnages are waste sent for recycling, therefore not including tonnages that have been rejected at the gate of the reprocessor.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThere are no comingled tonnages from 1996/97 to 1998/99.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThere is no data at this lower level for 2004/05 due to WasteDataFlow being introduced that year and about half the data having to be estimated.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n",
