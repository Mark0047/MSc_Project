        "notes": "The HES-MHMDS linkage will provide the ability to undertake national (within England) analysis along acute patient pathways for mental health service users, thereby enabling a much deeper understanding of mental health service users' interactions with acute secondary care. For example, analysis of the data could reveal how many patients, in contact with specialist mental health services, have been admitted to hospital for self-harm or have attended A&E. And from there you can start to assess whether they are receiving appropriate levels of care.\n\u00a0\nFor more information see HES-MHMDS web page at:http://www.hscic.gov.uk/hesmhmds",
