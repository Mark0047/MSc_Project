        "notes": "Countryside Stewardship (CS) was launched in 2015 and is a Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) grant scheme. It will contribute around \u00a3900 million over six years to help farmers and woodland managers look after the environment.\n\nWoodland is one of the scheme\u2019s priorities and funding is available to:\n- create new woodland\n- support the preparation of management plans\n- address tree health issues\n- improve existing woodlands\n\n\nThis dataset contains the sub-compartments that make up the CS applications approved by the Forestry Commission for the 2015 application window.  The data was recorded within the same system as the predecessor to CS, the English Woodland Grant Scheme (EWGS).  Therefore the structure of the data is very similar to that available for EWGS.\n\n\n\nFurther information can be found online here:\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/collections/countryside-stewardship-woodland-support\n\nThere are two spatial datasets associated with the CS for the 2015 grant intake.  These represent the Case Boundary and the Sub-compartments that are encapsulated by a case boundary.\n\nThe spatial datasets are related within the CS database on a 'one to many' basis.  This reflects the fact that a single CS case may have many sub-compartments.  Likewise, a single CS sub-compartment may  have several grant types applied to it.\n\n\nCS Sub-compartments\n\nSub-compartments are the smallest mapped unit of grant aided area under the CS.  Sub-compartments are aggregated up to Case Boundaries, and these boundaries are subsequently used to describe the  overall extent of the CS case.   A single case represents one application from an applicant for grant aid, and there may be a number of different grant types contained within a single case.\n\nAll sub-compartments for cases that have been approved (and were not subsequently withdrawn without payment) for the 2015 CS intake are contained in this dataset.\n\n\nAttributes:\n\nWorkAreaID = CS sub-compartment unique identifier\nCaseRef = CS Case unique identifier\nAreaHa = Area in hectares of sub-compartment\nSubCpt = The sub-compartment reference for the case\nPropName = The case name\nFSArea = The Forestry Commission Area who dealt with the case\nCaseType = The case type\nWCG = Presence or absence of the CS grant type Woodland Creation (Y/N)\nWIG = Presence or absence of the CS grant type Woodland Improvement (Y/N)\nWPG = Presence or absence of a Woodland Management Plan (Y/N)\nFLA = Presence or absence of a Felling Licence Application (Y/N)\nDateApprv = The date the case was approved by the Forestry Commission\nCurrStat = The status of the case at the time the data was created Attribution statement: Contains OS data \u00a9 Crown copyright [and database right] [year].",
