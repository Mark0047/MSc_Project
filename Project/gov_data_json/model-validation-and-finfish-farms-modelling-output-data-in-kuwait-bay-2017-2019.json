        "notes": "This data refers to a numerical model validation, in Kuwait Bay, for both the \nhydrodynamics and the biogeochemistry. Also, there is a dataset regarding finfish \nfarms modelling.\n\nDifferent types of data have been used for the model set up and observations for the \nmodel validation:\n\nPhysical and biogeochemical observations: data from the Kuwait Environment Public \nAuthority (KEPA) at various monitoring stations for more than 30 years, as part of \nKEPA\u2019s long-term water quality monitoring programme (`http://www.emisk.org/emisk/`_\n). Tidal velocities and water levels collected by the Kuwait Institute for Scientific \nResearch (KISR). \n\nBathymetry data: was the same as used by Bacon et al. (2014), which was based on \ncompilation of a single beam bathymetry survey conducted in May 2014, by the authors, \nand complemented with digitised sections of a hydrographic chart of the area (Mina Az \nZawr to Al Basrah and Bushehr-UKHO2884) (www.toddchart.com).\n\nTidal forcing: was obtained from the OTPS regional product for the Persian Gulf at \n1/60 degrees resolution (`http://volkov.oce.orst.edu/tides/PerS.html`_)\n\nTemperature and Salinity: data from the global ECMWF reanalysis model ORAP5.0, which \ncan be downloaded from \n`http://icdc.cen.uni-hamburg.de/1/projekte/easy-init/easy-init-ocean.html?no_cache=1`_\n.\n\nMeteorological forcing: obtained from the European Centre for Medium\u2010Range Weather \nForecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim.\n\n\n\n\n.. _`http://www.emisk.org/emisk/`:\n    http://www.emisk.org/emisk/\n\n.. _`http://volkov.oce.orst.edu/tides/pers.html`:\n    http://volkov.oce.orst.edu/tides/PerS.html\n\n.. _`http://icdc.cen.uni-hamburg.de/1/projekte/easy-init/easy-init-ocean.html?no_cache=1`:\n    http://icdc.cen.uni-hamburg.de/1/projekte/easy-init/easy-init-ocean.html?no_cache=1",
