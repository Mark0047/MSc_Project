Multidisciplinary studies further defined the Carboniferous and Devonian petroleum systems focused over and around the Mid North Sea High and northwards to the Orcadian Basin/East Shetland Platform. In the wider Irish Sea area, the focus was the Carboniferous play.</p><p>Coinciding with the release by  NSTA of the UK Government seismic across and around the Mid North Sea High frontier area, project results have been delivered digitally to project sponsors. They include seismic, well and gravity interpretations along with burial/uplift/maturity modelling, source rock geochemistry studies and palaeographic reconstructions to inform the location of prospective Carboniferous and Devonian plays. Onshore data and knowledge has been incorporated.</p><p>The results were published under the Open Government License in March 2017 and are loaded to the <a href='http://mapapps2.bgs.ac.uk/geoindex_offshore/home.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>BGS Offshore GeoIndex</a>.</p><p> Users should note that:</p><ul><li>These outputs are at a regional scale, created for project specific purposes and so should be used appropriately.</li><li>They are not BGS corporate products, but peer-reviewed project outputs.</li></ul>",
