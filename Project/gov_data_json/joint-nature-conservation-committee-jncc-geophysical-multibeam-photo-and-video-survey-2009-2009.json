        "notes": "This JNCC marine survey took place in July 2009 and surveyed two areas (Anton Dohrn seamount and East Rockall Bank Reef) for offshore Special Areas of Conservation (SACs). These areas are both now pSACs. The survey was commissioned by JNCC and undertaken by the British Geological Survey, University of Plymouth and Marin M\u00e4ttenik AB. The aim was to enable the distribution, extent and biological characterisation of Annex I reef. Sidescan sonar data was acquired using a MMT AB EdgeTech 2200-MP, Multibeam bathymetry data were collected using a Kongsberg EM710, a Seatronics Drop Frame Camera System was used for digital photography and video. The geology and geophysics component of the data are archived at the British Geological Survey (BGS) MEDIN Data Archive Centre (DAC) for Geology and Geophysics. Biological and bathymetry data are archived at DASSH and UKHO respectively. For more information see http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-5026. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS Commercial Report CR/09/113 (http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/511601/), http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/PDF/2009_3_JNCC_Cruise_Report_Public%20(2).pdf.",
