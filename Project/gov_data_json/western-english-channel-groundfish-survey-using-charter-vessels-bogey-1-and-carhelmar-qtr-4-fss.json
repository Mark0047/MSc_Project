        "notes": "This survey series ran from 1984 to 2013. The aim was to provide fisheries \nindependent abundance indices of all age groups of sole and plaice which are \nused in assessment working groups to tune the ICES stock assessment and to \nestimate recruitment. The survey was undertaken annually. Fifty eight trawl \nstations on the main sole grounds in the English waters of the Western English \nChannel were fished and sampled. Surveys were carried out on chartered \ncommercial fishing vessels with Cefas staff on board.\n\nCatches were sorted by starboard and port trawl. All commercial fish and \nshellfish species were identified either to species level or if not the \nhighest taxa and measured. Non-commercial species were predominately observed, \nalthough for a period of the survey-series length distributions were collected \nfor part of each survey. The epi-benthos was observed for the later part of \nthe survey-series. Sole and plaice were biological sampled for age \ndetermination purposes, and the collection of individual weights and \nmaturities.",
