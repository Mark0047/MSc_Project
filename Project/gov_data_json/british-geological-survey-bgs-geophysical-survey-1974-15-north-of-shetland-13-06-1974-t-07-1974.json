These purpose was to collect data as a pilot survey in areas of special interest to the Department of Energy and augment existing IGS seismic surveys. Sea floor data were collected using Echo Sounder. Gravimeter and Magnetometer equipment were also used. These data are archived by BGS. Details of the survey are contained in IGS Annual Report 1974.",
