Figures for a particular quarter may include receipts arising from a sale in another quarter, but do not include receipts arising from sales before 1 April 2012.  These figures represent the total receipt that and authority receives from the sale of a property after the Right to Buy Discount. A portion of these receipts are reserved for costs incurred by authorities in administering the RTB scheme, paying off additional local authority housing debt, an amount for authorities to use for general capital purposes, a share required by HM Treasury, and (in a small number of cases) for buying back former council properties, the remainder of the receipts are for the funding of additional homes for affordable or social rent.
