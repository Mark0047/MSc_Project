The survey was carried out by the British Geological Survey (BGS), Ghent University and Plymouth University as part of the FWO MINIMOUND project. Seabed samples were collected using British Geological Survey 6m vibrocorer. This archive contains acquisition data as supplied. This is a collaborative survey with Ghent University, Plymouth University and British Geological Survey as part of FWO MINIMOUND project. The aim of the survey was assessment of environmental drivers and anthropogenic impact using cold-water coral mini-mounds as analogue for giant mound growth. The cores will be archived by University of Ghent. Technical details of the survey are contained in RV Belgica Cruise 2014/16 report.",
