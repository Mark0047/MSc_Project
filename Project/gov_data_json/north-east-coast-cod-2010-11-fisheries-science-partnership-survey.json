The NE Coast cod surveys in 2003 and 2004 were largely exploratory, \nexamining factors such as the effect of gear type and time of day on catch \nrates of cod and other species. The objective of the survey series is to \nprovide year-on-year comparative information on distribution, relative \nabundance and size/age composition of NE coast cod and whiting. The surveys \nalso provide data on catches of other species important to the NE coast \nfishery, including haddock.",
