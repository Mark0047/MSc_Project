The mid and late 20th century saw extensive oceanographic \nresearch by DFS and Cefas. The resulting data were stored in an Oceanographic \nArchive which managed data from a number of sensor systems. These included a \nCTD system deployed for traditional oceanographic water column profiling. The \nCTD data have been transferred to the Cefas Data Hub as parameters. The \noriginal source files contain water column profile data on temperature, \nsalinity, suspended load and fluoresence derived chlorophyll. This metadata \nrecord covers UK Continental Shelf and temperature only.",
