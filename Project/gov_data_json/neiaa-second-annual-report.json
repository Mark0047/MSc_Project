        "notes": "The purpose of the NEIAA is to improve the quality of care for people living with inflammatory arthritis by measuring care provided to patients against the seven quality statements set out in NICE quality standard 33 (2013 version). \r\n\r\nThe audit assesses seven key metrics of care provided for people with new symptoms of arthritis attending rheumatology services for the first time:\r\n\r\n1. How quickly do primary care health professionals refer people suspected to have inflammatory arthritis?\r\n2. How soon after referral are people seen in secondary care? \r\n3. How long does it take to start treatment?\r\n4. Do patients receive timely education about their condition? \r\n5. Are treatment targets set and agreed?\r\n6. Do patients have access to emergency advice? \r\n7. Are annual reviews taking place?\r\n\r\nMore information can be found on the audit website (www.arthritisaudit.org.uk) ",
