As part of the aims of this survey, a grid of stations in \nthe western Irish Sea was sampled for plankton. A further set of plankton \nstations was sampled in an area south of Milford Haven and across the Bristol \nChannel to provide an indication of fish egg and larval distributions \nfollowing the Sea Empress oil spill and enable comparison with previous years.\n\nThe data described here consists of the numbers of ichthyo- and zooplankton \nanalysed and *Nephrops* larvae, along with associated positional and \nancillary data and volumes filtered.",
