        "notes": "In March 2010, the Scottish CCS (Carbon Capture & Storage) Consortium began an extensive Front End, Engineering and Design (FEED) study to assess what would be required from an engineering, commercial and regulatory, perspective in order to progress the CCS demonstration project at Longannet Power station in Scotland through to construction. The study yielded invaluable knowledge and the resulting material are available for download here. This section of the report illustrates how the End-to-End CCS chain must be considered as a system as well as separate elements. It builds upon the description of the individual elements contained in Section 3, and captures the development of the End-to-End CCS chain design carried out during FEED. Specifically, this section focuses on the following aspects: Commissioning the system in preparation for operations, as well as decommissioning at the end of the capture and storage period; Operations and maintenance activities; Control; Metering and monitoring; Venting; This section also provides some selected information on the individual CCS chain elements and a summary of the RAM (reliability, availability and maintainability) analysis undertaken during FEED of which one of the key outputs was the anticipated CO2 injection profile for the project. The appropriate summary section from the Feed Close Out Report can be downloaded as a PDF (End to end CCS chain operation.pdf). The main text of the FEED Close Out Report, together with the supporting appendix for this section can be downloaded as PDF files.
