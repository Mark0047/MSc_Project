        "notes": "The FCA and the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) both have responsibility for the regulation of mortgage lenders and administrators. They jointly publish the mortgage lending statistics every quarter.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of 2007, around 340 regulated mortgage lenders and administrators have been required to submit a Mortgage Lending and Administration Return (MLAR) each quarter, providing data on their mortgage lending activities.\r\n\r\n##Latest findings\r\n\r\n* The outstanding value of all residential mortgage loans was \u00a31,675.8 billion at the end of 2022 Q4, 3.9% higher than a year earlier.\r\n\r\n* The value of gross mortgage advances in 2022 Q4 was \u00a381.6 billion, which was \u00a34.3 billion lower than the previous quarter, but 16.3% higher than in 2021 Q4.\r\n\r\n* The value of new mortgage commitments (lending agreed to be advanced in the coming months) in 2022 Q4 was 33.5% less than the previous quarter and 24.5% less than a year earlier, at \u00a358.4 billion. If the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and period immediately thereafter is excluded, this was the lowest observed since 2015 Q1.",
