        "notes": "The British Geological Survey (BGS) were invited to participate in an Arts & Science cruise organised by the Cape Farewell charity, and carried out a geophysical survey in September - October 2008 in the Disko Bugt area of Western Greenland, on board the Grigory Mikheev. The purpose was to obtain sub-bottom profiles across modern active and ancient glacial features, to investigate the sequence stratigraphy laid down by large ice streams during the last glacial, and more modern sedimentary processes active in the interglacial. Sub bottom seismic profiling data were gathered by BGS using a surface tow Sparker. Most of the data were recorded digitally, but paper records were generated also. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS Internal Report IR/08/077.",
