The number of items and the \nweight in kg is reported for each litter category. The list of litter \ncategories was obtain merging OSPAR and Tangaroa Blue protocols with the \naddition of region-specific items. Item categories marked with '*' were added \nduring the operations in South Pacific, while item categories marked with '**' \nwere added during the operations in Belize. An array of metadata (location \nnames, survey date, GPS coordinates in decimal degrees) is also reported per \neach data point. \n\nThe file Belize_Marine_Litter_Metadata.csv reports other metadata \ncollected during the surveys following the OSPAR protocol to describe \nfactors potentially influencing litter characteristics. A READ-ME text file \ncontains a legend of the columns of the csv files.",
