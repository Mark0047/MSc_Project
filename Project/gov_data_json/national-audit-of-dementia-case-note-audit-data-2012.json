The audit was open to all general hospitals in England and Wales providing acute services on more than one ward and admitting adults over the age of 65.\r\nThe second round of audit examined the quality of care received by people with dementia admitted to general hospitals between September 2011 and February 2012. Case notes were audited against a checklist of standards that relate to the patient\u2019s admission, assessment, care planning and delivery, and discharge.\r\nAll acute Trusts/Health Boards in England and Wales registered one or more sites to participate, and 98% of eligible hospitals participated in the audit. Only English data are presented in this dataset, which includes data from 190 hospitals that submitted a total of 7380 case notes.\r\nSample size:\r\nEach participating hospital was requested to submit a sample of a minimum of 40 case notes. Please note that \u2018not applicable\u2019 responses were excluded from the analysis of questions, this may affect the number of case notes included in the analysis of individual questions. Questions presented in the \u2018discharge from hospital\u2019 section were not applicable to all patients in the sample (e.g. patients who died or were on end of life pathway) \u2013 a separate column presenting the sample size for each hospital in this section has been provided.\r\n",
