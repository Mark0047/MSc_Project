        "notes": "This dataset comprises the results of an expert consultation and \nepidemiological study conducted by Cefas and partners, as part of the Parafish \nControl project. The data were collected in order to produce a farm level \nmodelling tool which fish farmers can use to assess the potential economic \nimpact of parasites *Ceratothoa oestroides*, *Enteromixum leei* and \n*Sparicotyle chrysophrii *at the farm level. The relative risk posed to a \npotential or existing site based on characteristics such as the number of \nsupplying hatcheries, and number of farms operating in the area. Site \nmanagement practices such as frequency of mortality removal, use of fallowing, \nand frequency of net changes are also considered, and farmers are offered the \nchance to consider the cost associated with changing their practices to a \nlower risk option.\n\nThe underlying data used in the model calculations are yet to be published (as \nof 12/11/2019). They are derived from two connected studies which are \ndescribed briefly below. \n\nThe first of these was an expert consultation. Various risk factors associated \nwith the introduction and proliferation of these parasites at aquaculture \nsites were identified and an online questionnaire exploring their impacts in \nrelation to these risk factors was completed independently by a group of \nexperts (veterinarians, officials etc.). A Delphi style consultation meeting \nwas then held, where the questionnaire results were presented by a moderator \nand discussed by the experts, and agreement reached on numerical values.\n\nThe second study collected information from 39 mediterranean cage farms. The \ninformation collected covered the same range of risk factors as the previous \nstudy (farm location, size, environment, management and husbandry practices) \ntogether with information on their experience with the parasites (presence, \nassociated mortalities and growth retardation, parasite monitoring and \ntreatment).\n\nThe .csv files contain a subset of all the data collected which are relevant \nto the economic model, the factors having been determined based on statistical \nsignificance and practical relevance. \n\nThe full datasets from the two studies are not available at present. The data \nand associated reports are Confidential within the Parafish project but are \nbeing developed into peer-reviewed manuscripts. Links will be provided when \nthese are published.\n\nThe economic model can be found `here`_. \n\n\n\n\n.. _`here`:\n    https://openscience.cefas.co.uk/parafish_economic/",
