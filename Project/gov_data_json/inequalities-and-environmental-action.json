        "notes": "This report and dataset were commissioned by the Greater London Authority, and produced by Centric Lab to uncover the work of community groups that connect with environmental issues in Hackney, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest.\n\nThese four boroughs were selected as they have some of the highest representation of multi-ethnic low income communities who were greatly affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Many reports highlighted the role of environmental pollutants and structural deprivation as a determinant of Covid-19 infection and impact.\n\nAs evidenced in this report communities demonstrate numerous and diverse capabilities in tackling the structural challenges of modern day London. This report highlights the different community groups committed to improving the lives of their families, neighbours, and future generations who grace the place they call home. The Mayor of [London\u2019s Engaging Londoners in Recovery Programme 2021-2023](https://www.london.gov.uk/decisions/md2848-engaging-londoners-recovery-programme-2021-2023) sets out an agenda to champion this intellect and capacity to help deliver bottom-up led change in policy such as that of a [Green New Deal for London](https://www.london.gov.uk/coronavirus/londons-recovery-coronavirus-crisis/recovery-context/green-new-deal).\n\nThis report was produced in late 2021 and early 2022 when \u2018Plan B\u2019 Covid-19 restrictions were in place for most of its duration. This project was a desktop study and focused on working remotely. All data was gathered through online means and digital communications. This means that despite collating the amazing work of 143 organisations there\u2019s a chance some were missed due to low digital visibility.",
