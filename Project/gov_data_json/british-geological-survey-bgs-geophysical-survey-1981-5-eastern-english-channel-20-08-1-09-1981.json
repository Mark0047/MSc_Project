(IGS Report No 121) There were two objectives of this project, the first being to complete the regional survey of the Dungeness-Boulogne sheet of the IGS 1:250000 map series. The second objective was to carry out a gravity and megnetic survey in the Caen and Rouen sheets, in order to complete the gravity coverage of the entire English Channel. A secondary objective was to run a few isolated gravity lines in Bournemouth Bay and off Dartmouth to fill in small gaps in the existing data.",
