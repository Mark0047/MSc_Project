Hutchinson. Surveys associated with this reserach 1968/7 and 1968/8. The purpose was to collect data as part of a study of the Humber Estuary sediment type distribution; geological structure of the superficial deposits; depths to rockhead beneath superficial deposits and structure of solid rocks. Sea floor data were collected using echosounder and Sidescan Sonar. Sub-bottom profiling data were collected using Pinger and Sparker. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in IGS report 69/3 (WB/MC/69/3). McQuillin, R. 1969. Cruise Report: Humber Investigations, 1968.",
