        "notes": "The FCA analyses data, between 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022, resulting from action taken against authorised firms breaching financial promotion rules and referrals and investigations into unregulated activity.\r\n\r\nFinancial services play a critical role in the lives of everyone in the UK. The rising cost of living continues to heavily impact consumers, with the most vulnerable being hit the hardest, so it is important for consumers to get the outcomes they need from financial markets. A large part of delivering good consumer outcomes is linked to good quality marketing information. Unclear or misleading marketing is highly concerning because of the complex and often long-term nature of financial products. It is more important than ever that financial promotions are responsible and clear so consumers can commit to appropriate financial products.\r\n\r\nThis data provides an overview of how the FCA is working to improve standards across the market so that consumers are provided with clear, fair and not misleading financial promotions to enable them to make an informed decision before parting with their money. It brings together the data and themes reported in the FCA's quarterly financial promotions publications during 2022, where it significantly increased its intervention activity. The FCA expects firms to read this and take necessary steps to ensure they deliver good consumer outcomes. It will continue its intervention activity where it has identify authorised and unauthorised firms and/or individuals causing consumer harm.    \r\n\r\n##What\u2019s included in the data\r\n* key messages\r\n* examples of the FCA's work on financial promotions during 2022\r\n* information on how to report a misleading financial advert or potential scam",
