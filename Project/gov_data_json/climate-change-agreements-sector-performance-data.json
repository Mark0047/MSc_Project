        "notes": "The Climate Change Agreements (Administration) Regulations 2012 require the administrator to publish a report setting out the energy efficiency improvements and emissions reductions achieved by participants.\nClimate Change Agreements (CCAs) are voluntary agreements that set targets on operators to improve their energy efficiency and/or reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The CCA scheme runs from 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2025.  Eligibility to participate in the scheme requires operators to carry out one or more listed \u2018eligible activities\u2019. Operators that enter into and abide by the terms and conditions of their CCA are entitled to claim a discount on the Climate Change Levy (CCL), a tax added to electricity, gas and solid fuel bills by suppliers.  Operators must report their energy consumption, carbon emissions and performance against their target for each of the four biennial target periods between 2013 and 2020.  Operators meeting their target at the end of each target period will be certified as eligible to claim a discount on the CCL.\nParticipants in the CCA scheme are split across 53 industrial sectors each of which is represented by a trade association or other body.  These trade associations manage the submissions from operators carrying out activities which fall within their sector.  Each sector holds an umbrella agreement, setting out the improvement targets for each of the four biennial target periods.  Sub-sectors may be set up as a practical means of partitioning target units (operators), which either carry out similar activities or have similar target types.\nThis data set contains the performance results for each of the sectors participating in the Climate Change Agreements (CCA) scheme.  The data should be read in combination with the previous biennial reports located on GOV.UK. \nData may not be included for some target units where a case for commercial confidentiality has been accepted.
