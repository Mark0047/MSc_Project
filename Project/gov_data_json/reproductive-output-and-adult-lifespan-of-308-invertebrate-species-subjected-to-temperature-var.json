        "notes": "[This dataset is embargoed until December 31, 2024]. This dataset contains extracted data from studies reporting the effect of temperature on animal reproduction and adult lifespan. To identify studies, we performed a systematic literature search using the online database Web of Science in August 2021 (see Dougherty et al. (2024) for details). From this search, 781 studies were screened, and 339 studies met our inclusion criteria. These studies all experimentally manipulate temperature in a laboratory setting, usually for more than five days. The studies tested 308 species in total, all of which are invertebrates, mostly from the order Insecta (77%) or Arachnida (15%). From these studies we extracted reported data for the average reproductive output and adult lifespan (plus associated variances and sample sizes) for each tested temperature treatment. Means and variances were then converted into standardised effect sizes for further meta-analysis. We used the standardised mean difference (SMD) in reproduction or adult lifespan between pairwise temperature treatments as the effect size (response variable). SMDs were calculated in a pairwise fashion in relation to a single \u2018reference\u2019 treatment. The reference treatment was assigned as: a) the treatment closest to the rearing temperature of the study population, or b) the treatment with a temperature closest to 25\u2103 (in the absence of a reported rearing temperature). For each effect size, we also report information relating to the focal species (e.g. taxonomic group, focal sex, habitat, fertilisation mode) and relevant methodological details (e.g. experimental temperature, exposure duration, which life stage was exposed). The dataset consists of all data needed to repeat the meta-analyses: two csv files containing extracted effect size data, and two phylogenetic trees showing the relationships between the species included in the analysis.
