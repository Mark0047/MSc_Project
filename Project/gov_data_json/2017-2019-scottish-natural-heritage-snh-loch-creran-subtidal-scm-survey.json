Video data collected during this survey and previous surveys in 2005 and 2014 has been used to assess development of the features over time. The aims of this study were to carry out site condition monitoring of the biogenic sub-features of the loch in order to identify any deterioration in the condition of the features and to form a judgement on their current condition and to assess the current condition of the flame shell bed feature.",
