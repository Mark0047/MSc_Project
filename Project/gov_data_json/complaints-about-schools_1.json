        "notes": "The Department for Education is committed to continuous improvement in its handling of complaints about schools.  The completed report covers complaints that relate to state funded schools including academies and free schools, received by the department in the period 1st August 2012 to July 2013.\r\nPrior to July 2012 some complaints about schools were handled by the Secretary of State for Education, some were handled as a pilot by the Local Government Ombudsman(LGO). The Education Act 2011 rationalised the LGO arrangements . In July 2012 the powers of the LGO to consider school complaints were repealed, so that all complainants in England could complain to the Secretary of State about a school.  During the passage of the Education Act 2011, the department commissioned independent research about its handling of complaints about schools. This report covers those findings and can be located here:- \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/complaints-about-schools-customer-satisfaction-survey-2013",
