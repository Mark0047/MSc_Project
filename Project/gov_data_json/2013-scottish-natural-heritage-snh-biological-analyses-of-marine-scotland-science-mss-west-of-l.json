        "notes": "The purpose of this benthic survey (cruise 1013A) west of Lewis was to improve knowledge of the occurrence and distribution of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance, particularly priority marine features (PMFs), because the area is one of a number of proposed renewable energy locations. An underwater video survey were conducted by MSS for MSS on the 5th and 6th August 2013 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 23 sites. Analyses on the images, commissioned by SNH, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. MSS used the vessel FRV Alba na Mara for this survey.",
