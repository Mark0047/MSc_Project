Additionally, appropriate biomarker studies allow\nage-diagnostic assessment of any oils sampled allowing oil-source correlations\nto be attempted.</p><p>\n\n</p><p>East Shetland Platform:</p><p>\n\n</p><ul>\n <li><span style=''>Analysis of Devonian\n     source rocks suggests that oil-prone Middle and potentially Lower Devonian\n     source rocks, albeit with relatively modest TOC, exist across the study\n     area.</span></li>\n <li><span style=''>Geochemically at least\n     two Palaeozoic oil families have been identified, both of which can\n     seemingly be differentiated from Kimmeridge Clay Formation sourced oils.</span></li>\n <li><span style=''>The highest risk\n     associated with play models in this area which utilise an intra-platform\n     Devonian source rock is related to its maturity timing, with the most\n     pessimistic scenarios being of pre-Jurassic hydrocarbon expulsion.</span></li>\n <li><span style=''>The eastern portion of\n     the Crawford-Skipper Basin is prospective, if material source rocks exist\n     in the Devonian sequence.</span></li>\n <li><span style=''>The geochemistry of the\n     oil stains characterised in this study in Quad 9 are suggestive of the\n     presence of oils not related to the KCF system and lends credence to the\n     potential for Palaeozoic source plays in this area.</span></li></ul><div>\n\n<p>SW Approaches:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li><span style=''>Material source rocks in\n     the Early Jurassic are proven to exist; the oil shows reported have\n     largely been proven\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and typed to Early Jurassic source\n     rocks.</span></li>\n <li><span style=''>Some of these shows\n     occur in Triassic stratigraphy, suggesting some complex migration paths\n     are operating, at least locally.</span></li>\n <li><span style=''>Basin modelling suggests\n     the principal sensitivity to the volumes generated is the location of the\n     source rock with the Lower Jurassic stratigraphy (reflecting its\n     thickness); with an order of magnitude difference in volumes for modelling\n     at the uppermost versus lowermost Lower Jurassic.</span></li>\n <li><span style=''>Many of the wells\n     drilled in the vicinity of the kitchens mapped in this study were either\n     targeted at base Cretaceous closures (e.g. 73/12-1) or apparently failed\n     to target any genuine trapping feature (e.g. most wells in the South\n     Celtic Sea) potentially reflecting the vintage of these wells, which were\n     drilled on 2D data.
