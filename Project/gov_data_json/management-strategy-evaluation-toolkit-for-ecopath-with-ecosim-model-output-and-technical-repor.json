        "notes": "This dataset consists of output from a computer model that predicts responses \nof 69 functional groups from plankton to whales to changing fishing pressure. \nScenarios are run using the newly built plug-in (see report) that allows for \nan assessment of the effect of model parameter uncertainty. The base model is \nthe ICES key-run of EwE for the North Sea described here \n`http://data.cefas.co.uk/#/View/2847`_. Format of the data: Zipped csv files \ncovering the hindcast period 1991-2013 (inclusive) with 20 year forecasts. \nOutput includes annual average values for the whole North Sea: For both \nfunctional groups and fishing fleets: landings (tonnage and value, \u00a3), \ndiscards (tonnage),for functional groups only: biomass (tonnage) and fishing \nmortality (split by landings and discards), for fishing fleets only: fishing \neffort relative to 1990. Also identified are 'choke species' that lead to \nclosure of fisheries. The report (pdf) describes the development of a tool for \nassessing the effect of model parameter uncertainty on the performance of \nmanagement options simulated using an ecosystem model. It provides the \nrationale, description of methods and algorithms, and a step-by-step guide for \nusers of the tool. While the interface of the tool is designed to be user \nfriendly, the setup of input files and its application requires a thorough \nunderstanding of the parameterisation of Ecopath models, advanced experience \nwith Ecosim and understanding of Management Strategy Evaluation procedures.\n\n\n\n\n.. _`http://data.cefas.co.uk/#/view/2847`:\n    http://data.cefas.co.uk/#/View/2847",
