        "notes": "Status field - 1 = Footpath, 2 = Bridleway, 3 = Byway, 9 = Restricted Byway*.\r\n\r\nThe public rights of way data displayed is for information and general use purposes only and is not the legal record.\r\nThe precise position and alignment of public rights of way can only be determined by reference to the Definitive Map and Statement, the legal record of public rights of way, and the data displayed on the attached plan has been produced by capturing and transposing of the Definitive Map onto a larger scale.  The Council can accept no responsibility for any error or inaccuracy which may arise from the transposition of the public rights of way shown on the Definitive Map to a different scale.\r\n\r\nThe absence of a right of way on the Definitive Map does not mean that a right of way does not exist, nor does it guarantee that a public or private right of some other kind has not arisen over the land.\r\n\r\nFor further details contact the Public Rights of Way section\r\n\r\n*The designation restricted byway was introduced as a new type of highway in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. It is defined as a highway over which the public have restricted byway rights, with or without the right to drive animals of any description. \"Restricted byway rights\" include a right of way on foot, on horseback or leading a horse and a right of way for vehicles other than mechanically propelled vehicles (this includes a right of way for pedal cycles and horse drawn vehicles).\r\n\r\nPRIORITY SYSTEM\r\nCornwall Council, as the Highways Authority, has a duty to keep the entire public rights of way network open and available for use by the public at all times. However, we have chosen to operate a priority system based on a set of criteria that designate all paths as Gold, Silver, Bronze or Dual Status. The priority assigned to the path indicates the comparative level of funding that will be allocated to the path for its maintenance both in terms of the budget provided to parish councils under the Local Maintenance Partnership and through Cornwall Council's provider, Cormac Solutions Limited, for the resolution of defects identified and reported.\r\n\r\nGold priority paths are those that form part of promoted national or regional trails (or provide connections to them), paths within 1km of a settlement of greater than 1,000 people, paths to well established visitor attractions, other paths that are known to be popular, paths that are accessible to those with limited mobility or sensory impairment and bridleways and byways used by equestrians and cyclists. Gold CP paths are those that form part of or provide links to, or from, the South West Coast Path.\r\n\r\nSilver priority paths are those that have potential to provide new promoted routes, provide access to attractive landscape features, provide access to CROW Access Land or connect to public transport nodes.\r\n\r\nBronze priority paths are those that are dead ends, run parallel to others that clearly have higher priority, would require excessive investment compared with the value of the route or those that are under legal or definitive map review or possibly subject to diversion or extinguishment orders that negate the investment.\r\n\r\nDual Status paths are those that are also highways maintained at the public expense by the Highways division.\r\n\r\nHowever, all paths, irrespective of priority, will be dealt with as a priority if a high risk (Category 1) health and safety problem is identified through a risk assessment.",
