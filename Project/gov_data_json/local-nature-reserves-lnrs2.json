        "notes": "This spatial dataset contains the digital boundaries of Local Nature Reserves (LNRs) in Wales. Local Nature Reserves are established and managed by local authorities, following consultation with Natural Resources Wales (NRW) under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. For a site to become an LNR it must have natural features of special interest to the local area, and the authority must either have a legal interest in the land or have an agreement with the owner to manage the land as a reserve. LNR prove to be useful not only to protect habitats and wildlife but increase people's awareness of their environment. They are places where children can learn about nature, and they are often situated in or near urban areas. Please refer to Countryside Act 1949 for re\nasons for capture of original designation. With the coming of GIS and its use in government departments and commercial companies mobilising the data in this way, advances the protection of these sites and the efficiency of decision making. The LNRs have been designated over a number of years, from 1970 to the present day, and are on-going. The data has been held digitally since mid1990s. This data can be subject to change by the local authority at anytime.",
