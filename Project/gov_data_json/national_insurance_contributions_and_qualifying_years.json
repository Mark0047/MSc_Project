        "notes": "This release provides the latest estimates on people who have paid National Insurance contributions since 1978/79. The figures show all the contribution types that a person has paid during the year. Therefore the figures are not mutually exclusive and will include an element of double counting if a person has paid a number of contribution types; for example, self employed and employed earner contributions. A person may pay a number of types of contribution at any one time, particularly if the person has a number of employments in the year, either running consecutively or concurrently.\r\n\r\nhttps://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/index.php?page=stpp_cq\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-insurance-contributions-statistics\r\n\r\nSource agency: Work and Pensions\r\n\r\nDesignation: National Statistics\r\n\r\nLanguage: English\r\n\r\nAlternative title: NICs and Qrs",
