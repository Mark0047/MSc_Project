        "notes": "This report is a contribution to the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA7) conducted by the Department of Trade and Industry (now Department of Energy and Climate Change). The purpose of this report was to provide an assessment of the plankton ecology for SEA7.\n\nOwing to the size of the area being assessed this report divides the region into two sections. The basis of this division follows the 200m depth contour generally accepted as being the boundary between the shelf edge and oceanic realms. The first section being waters found on the continental shelf and are therefore more prone to freshwater runoff from land and anthropogenic inputs. The second section represents waters off the shelf edge, these waters are of a more oceanic origin and are less impacted by inputs from land-based sources. \n\nInformation on the nutrient biogeochemistry (nitrate, phosphate and silicate) are presented for three geographical provinces, the oceanic and shelf edge realms outlined above and also for the Clyde Sea area this being a region noted as having elevated nutrient loadings from anthropogenic sources.",
