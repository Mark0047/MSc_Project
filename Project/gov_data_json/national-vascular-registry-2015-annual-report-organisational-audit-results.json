There are a number of national clinical audits within NCAPOP. Each one collects data on the care received by different groups of patients and provides local NHS trusts with reports on their practice and performance.\r\n\r\nThis dataset contains the results published within the 2015 Annual Report relating to the organisational audit carried out in August 2015. The results are based on services on 03/08/2015.",
