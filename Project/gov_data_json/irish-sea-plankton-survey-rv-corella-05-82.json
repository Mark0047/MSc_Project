In addition to Nephrops \nlarvae, fish eggs and larvae were also analysed. The data described here \nconsists of the numbers of Nephrops larvae and fish eggs and larvae identified \nfrom the main net samples collected on a survey in April 1982, along with \nassociated positional and ancillary data and volumes filtered.",
