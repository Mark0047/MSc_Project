The dataset provides counts of benefit claimants categorised by their statistical group (their main reason for interacting with the benefit system), gender and age.\n\nSource: Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)\n\nPublisher: Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)\n\nGeographies: Local Authority District (LAD), Government Office Region (GOR), National\n\nGeographic coverage: Great Britain\n\nTime coverage: 1999 to 2008\n\nType of data: Administrative data\n\nNotes: The main advantage of this dataset is that the double counting of claimants of multiple benefits has been removed so that users will get a more accurate picture of benefit claiming among people of pensionable age",
