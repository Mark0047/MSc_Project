        "notes": "Four resources are available on this record for 2018:\n- the Waste Data Interrogator (in MS Access), \n- an excel extract of the data from within the interrogator,\n- waste returns for incinerators (that are not included in the interrogator).\n- summary tables for England and the former planning regions (in open document spreadsheet format)\n\nAll operators of regulated waste management facilities have to provide us with details of the quantities and types of waste they deal with i.e. waste received into site and waste sent on from site to other facilities or processes. This data is used to monitor compliance but has historically been used by the EC, DEFRA and local authorities to assist in planning for new waste facilities and for monitoring against statutory targets. We have provided this data in an interrogatable format since 2006. The dataset is calendar year and holds the data from around 6,000 regulated sites. Operator waste returns are public register information unless a claim for commercial confidentiality has been accepted. In these cases the data is provided but the site details are not. This is so that the data can be included in aggregated figures but cannot be attributed to a particular site. Data supplied does not include details of waste producers\n\nINFORMATION WARNING \nDetails of operators who have claimed commercial confidentiality are not provided\n\nVERSION UPDATES\nVersion 2 of the 2018 Waste Summary Table for England was updated in October 2019. Errors were found in the remaining landfill capacity for 2 sites in the East of England.  All references to this data were updated in the England and East of England tables.\n\nVersion 1 of the Waste Data Interrogator (MS Access) was updated in early November after customer feedback on the time taken to run queries.  Structural changes have significantly improved query run time.  The data in the Interrogator has not changed from that originally published.
