        "notes": "This dataset provides the field data collected in 2016 to assess the functionality and performance of 600 handpumped borehole supplies (HPBs) across the three countries, Ethiopia, Malawi and Uganda, and the capacity of the community water management arrangements. The individual HPBs surveyed in the dataset were selected by a two or three stage randomised sampling approach. The UPGro Hidden Crisis project (2015-20) was an international research project aimed at developing a robust evidence base and understanding of the complex and multi-faceted causes which underlie the current high failure rates of many new groundwater supplies in Africa. The project was jointly funded by: DFID, NERC and ESRC as part of the UPGro programme. The project carried out the research work in three countries - Ethiopia, Malawi and Uganda \u2013 to examine functionality and performance of groundwater supplies in a range of hydrogeological, climatic and social, institutional and governance environments in East Africa. The work focused specifically on examining the functionality of HPBs \u2013 these being the main form of improved community water supply across rural Africa. The Survey 1 dataset, is major dataset developed by the project.",
