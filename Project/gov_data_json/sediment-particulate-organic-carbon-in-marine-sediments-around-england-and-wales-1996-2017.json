        "notes": "Sediment particulate organic carbon (and nitrogen) data from marine samples \ncollected between 1996-2017 around England and Wales. Measurements for less \nthan 2mm sediment fraction or/and less than 63 micron sediment fraction are \ngiven. Silt/clay percentage is also included (for either/both sieving and \nlaser methodologies) as well as sample weight where available. These data have \nbeen collated from a variety of sources, including CSEMP monitoring, nephrops \nmonitoring, fishing pressures research and the NERC shelf seas programme to \nsupport on-going investigations for the Cefas/Defra project ''Operational \nindicators of seafloor integrity'. This new revision includes new data from \nsamples collected in 2015 to 2017, including CSEMP monitoring and MPA \nmonitoring surveys (core as well as surface). The work to create this revision \nwas conducted under work package 5 \u201cData Synthesis and Management of Marine \nand Coastal Carbon\u201d (C6090, NE/K001914/1) of the Shelf Sea Biogeochemistry \nprogramme jointly funded by the National Environment Research Council (NERC) \nand the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) of the \nUnited Kingdom.",
