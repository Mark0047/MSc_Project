For each for each data value one can be 95% certain the true value lies between the lower and upper confidence limits. Counts and rates for economic activity, employment, and economic inactivity are derived from the ONS Annual Population Survey (APS). This is a National Statistics product and is therefore produced to a high standard. The figures are based on a sample survey, so (as with all surveys) some assumptions have been made about the entire population of each area based on the survey sample. Therefore there is some inherent uncertainty around the data published and the true value.#Data rounded to the nearest 100.",
