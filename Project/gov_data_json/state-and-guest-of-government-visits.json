For such visits the FCO covers the cost of accommodation, transport, food and incidentals (to a set limit) in the UK for the Official Delegation (Principal plus a maximum of ten Ministers or Senior Officials) during the official programme only. Accommodation costs for one FCO Visit Officer are also paid. International air fares for the visiting delegation are the responsibility of the Government concerned. Costs for State and Guest of Government visits vary depending on the rank of the principal, the length of visit, numbers in the delegation and individual programme requirements. The Royal Family and UK Ministers receive similar treatment on some visits overseas, when the host country covers the costs. ",
