This \ndata consists of the numbers of fish eggs and larvae, along with associated \npositional data and volumes filtered.\n\nA fine mesh (80 micron) 'PUP' sampler, attached to the frame of the Gulf VII \nsampler, was used to collect plankton samples for analysis of zooplankton \nspecies. These were analysed under Cefas contract C3576 and are recorded \nseparately.",
