        "notes": "This British Geological Survey (BGS) regional marine geophysical and sampling survey (comprised of five legs) took place from June to August in SW Approaches and from August to October 1977 in Northern North Sea on board the MV Emerald. Seabed samples and cores were collected using Shipek grab, Day grab, Gravity corer, Vibrocorer, 1m rock drill and cone dredge. SW Approaches used Shipek grab,Gravity corer and Vibrocorer a total of 879 stations occupied. Seismic equipment was not routinely used. Sidescan sonar used on SW Approaches Leg 3. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS Internal Report 77/10 to 14, Details for SW Approaches in report by C G Bradley Mv Emerald Cruise 1 June - 10 August 1977. Sample descriptions can be found in Offshore Reports 2000/35-37.",
