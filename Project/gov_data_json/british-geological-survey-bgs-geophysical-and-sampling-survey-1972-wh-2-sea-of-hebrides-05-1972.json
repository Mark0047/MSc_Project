Sea floor data were collected using an echosounder. Subsurface data were gathered using pinger and sparker equipment, a total of 460km were covered. Seabed samples and borehole cores were collected using a Hydrocorer and wireline drilling. Five borehole sites drilled. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS Internal Report WB/72/3.",
