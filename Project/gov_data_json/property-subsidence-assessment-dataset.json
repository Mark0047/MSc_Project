        "notes": "The property subsidence assessment dataset provides an understanding of the shrink-swell hazard at both the individual property and/or postcode level for England and Wales. It builds upon the BGS GeoSure shrink-swell data by mapping the hazard to the individual building polygon and considering the other susceptibility factors of building type, foundation depth, and drainage and tree proximity. The data consist of GIS building polygons with an overall susceptibility to subsidence score between 1-100. Scores are also classified from non-plastic to very high. Each building polygon is also scored from 1-10 for each subsidence factor (geology, foundation, drainage, building type, building storey and tree proximity). Postcode data is also available as a table showing the \u2018average\u2019 PSA score for all buildings within the postcode. The identification of shrink-swell related subsidence prone areas, alongside the inclusion of potential sources to exacerbate these phenomena, can better inform insurers and homeowners and form the basis to make decisions concerning prevention and remediation. The product enhances geological information obtained from GIP (BGS GeoSure Insurance Product) and GeoSure via the inclusion of the crucial shrink-swell susceptibility factors (proximity to trees and foundation depth). This therefore allows the derivation of a risk element for the housing stock at Building level, which is then generalised to Postcode level.
