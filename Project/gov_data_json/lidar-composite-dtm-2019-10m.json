A new version of the data is available here: https://environment.data.gov.uk/dataset/ce8fe7e7-bed0-4889-8825-19b042e128d2\n\nThe LIDAR Composite DTM (Digital Terrain Model) is a raster elevation model covering >85% of England at 10m spatial resolution. This 10m model is a resampled version of the 2m DTM produced by the Environment Agency in 2019. The DTM is derived from a combination of our Time Stamped archive and National LIDAR Programme, which has been merged and re-sampled to give the best possible coverage. Where repeat surveys have been undertaken the newest, best resolution data is used. Where data was resampled a bilinear interpolation was used before being merged. A bilinear interpolation method was used to resampled from 2m to 10m resolution. \n\nThe 2019 LIDAR Composite contains surveys undertaken between 12th March 1998 and 1st September 2019. Please refer to the survey index files which shows, for any location, what Time Stamped survey or National LIDAR Programme block went into the production of the LIDAR composite for a specific location. \n\nThis resampled 10m dataset is available to download as a single GeoTiff Raster file from a sharefile link. Data is presented in metres, referenced to Ordinance Survey Newlyn, using the OSTN\u201915 transformation. \n\nThe DTM (Digital Terrain Model) is produced from the last return LIDAR signal. We remove surface objects from the Digital Surface Model (DSM), using bespoke algorithms and manual editing of the data, to produce a terrain model of just the surface. \n \nLight Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) is an airborne mapping technique, which uses a laser to measure the distance between the aircraft and the ground. Up to 500,000 measurements per second are made of the ground, allowing highly detailed terrain models to be generated at spatial resolutions of between 25cm and 2 metres. The Environment Agency\u2019s open data LIDAR archives includes the point cloud data, and derived raster surface models of survey specific areas dating back to 1998 and composites of the best data available in any location. \n\nThis metadata record is for Approval for Access product AfA458.\nAttribution Statement: \u00a9 Environment Agency copyright and/or database right 2020.
