        "notes": "The Carotid Interventions Audit was initiated in 2005 as a collaboration between the Vascular Society of Great Britain & Ireland and the Royal College of Physicians. The purpose of the Audit was to gather information about the pathway of care for patients with carotid stenosis who undergo carotid interventions (either surgery or endovascular stenting).\r\nIn January 2013, the National Vascular Registry was formed by the amalgamation of the National Vascular Database and the UK Carotid Interventions Audit projects. The Registry was commissioned by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP) as part of the National Clinical Audit and Patient Outcomes Programme (NCAPOP) and is based in the Clinical Effectiveness Unit of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. The aim of the Registry is to measure the quality and outcomes of care for patients who undergo vascular surgery in England and Wales.\r\nThe results presented in the spreadsheets below are for English NHS trusts who participated in Round 5 of the audit, which included operations performed between 1 October 2011 and 30 September 2012. Results are available for all participating UK NHS trusts/health boards within the Round 5 report.\r\n",
