        "notes": "This is an overview of geographical cash access coverage in the UK at the end of the fourth quarter (October to December) of 2022. This monitoring forms part of the FCA\u2019s work on access to cash.\r\n\r\nOn a quarterly basis, the FCA, along with the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR), gather and update data on access to cash. This captures the locations of cash access points and other relevant information like temporary closures, opening hours, and accessibility. This data covers brick-and-mortar, mobile bank, and building society branches, automated teller machines (ATMs), and the Post Office network. We supplement this information with annual data on cashback locations.\r\n\r\nPreviously the summary focused on coverage within 2km and 5km of a cash access point. Starting this quarter the primary measurements of coverage will focus on deposit and withdrawal facilities in urban areas at 1 mile and rural areas at 3 miles. \r\n\r\nThe FCA estimates that for access to larger banks and building societies providing Personal Current Accounts (PCA) and Post Office: all branches, including mobile bank branches:\r\n\r\n* 97.4% of the UK urban population are currently within 1 mile of a free-to-use cash access point offering deposits\r\n* 98.3% of the UK rural population are currently within 3 miles of a free-to-use cash access point offering deposits\r\n\r\nThe FCA  estimates that for access to any bank, building society, Post Office branch, or any free ATM:\r\n\r\n* 99.3% of the UK urban population are currently within 1 mile of a free-to-use cash access point offering withdrawals\r\n* 98.7% of the UK rural population are currently within 3 miles of a free-to-use cash access point offering withdrawals\r\n\r\n",
