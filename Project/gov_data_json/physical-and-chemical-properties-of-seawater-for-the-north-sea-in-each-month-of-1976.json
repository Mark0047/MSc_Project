Data \nprovided: date; station number; time; position (latitude and longitude); \ndepth; tide direction; wind speed and direction. Environmental variables \nmeasured include: temperature (surface and bottom), saliny, transparency (%), \nnutrient concentrations (nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, silicate); chlorophyll-a \n(total and nano); phaeophytin (total and nano). These data have been converted \ninto digital format (excel files); however there is more data collected during \nthe same survey (e.g. fish stomach content; fish larvae counts; phytoplankton \ncounts) that has not been converted and is still in paper format (paper \nrecords are kept by Steve Milligan, Plankton Lab).",
