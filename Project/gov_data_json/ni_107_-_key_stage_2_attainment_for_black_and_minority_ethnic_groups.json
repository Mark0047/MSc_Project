        "notes": "Key Stage (KS) 2 is the stage of the National Curriculum between ages 8 and 11 years. This indicator relates to tests taken by 11 year olds at the end of KS2. Minority ethnic groups measured for the purposes of this indicator include any ethnic group where there are over 30 pupils from that group in any particular cohort. Pupils attainment is assessed in relation to the National Curriculum and pupils are awarded levels on the National Curriculum scale to reflect their attainment.  Good performance is typified by higher percentages accompanied by a narrowing of the attainment gap between minority ethnic pupils and all pupils.\n\nSource: Department for Children Schools and Families (DCSF): Pupil Annual School Level Census (PLASC)\n\nPublisher: DCLG Floor Targets Interactive\n\nGeographies: Local Authority District (LAD), County/Unitary Authority, Government Office Region (GOR), National\n\nGeographic coverage: England\n\nTime coverage: 2004/05 to 2007/08\n\nType of data: Administrative data",
