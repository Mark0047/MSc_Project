        "notes": "This dataset combines average daily temperature and soil moisture data from nine experimental plots at the climate change field site Climoor located in Clocaenog forest, NE Wales. Soil temperature is measured at 5 cm and 20 cm soil depth (degrees Celsius), and soil moisture is measured as soil volumetric water content (m3 per m3). The experimental field site consists of three untreated control plots (Plots 3, 6 and 9), three plots where the plant canopy air is artificially warmed during night time hours (Plots 1, 2 and 7) and three plots where rainfall is excluded from the plots at least during the plants growing season (Plots 4, 5 and 8). Data is an extension of the micromet datasets covering 1998-2015 and 2015-2016; adding the time period September 2016 to December 2021. Soil temperatures were measured with T107 sensors, and soil moisture was measured with CS616 sensors, both from Campbell scientific. Temperature and moisture data were recorded in minute intervals, and automatically averaged as half-hourly by the data logger. Half-hourly data were automatically transferred to CEH/UKCEH servers using remote telemetry. Data which were not recorded are marked with \u201cNA\u201d, faulty data were replaced with \u201c-9999\u201d. The Climoor field experiment intends to answer questions regarding the effects of warming and drought on ecosystem processes. The reported data are collected to monitor site specific environmental conditions and their development with time. These data are important to interpret results that are collected from the climate change manipulations imposed in the field.
