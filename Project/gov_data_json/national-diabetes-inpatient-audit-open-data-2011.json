The data are also being made available on the data.gov website. \r\n\r\nWhat information is being made available? \r\n\r\nAudit participation by NHS Trust and data completeness for the key fields. \r\n\r\nMeasures about the process of care given to patients. \r\n\r\nInformation about care outcomes and treatment. \r\n\r\nTrusts and Networks are identified by name and their national code. These data do not list individual patient information, nor do they contain any patient identifiable data. \r\n\r\nThe National Diabetes Inpatient Audit (NaDIA) is commissioned by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP) and delivered by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, working with Diabetes UK. \r\n\r\nThe National Diabetes Inpatient Audit is a snapshot audit of diabetes inpatient care in England. The audit is set out to answer the following questions: \r\n\r\nDid diabetes management minimise the risk of avoidable complications? \r\n\r\nDid harm result from the inpatient stay? \r\n\r\nWas patient experience of the inpatient stay favourable? \r\n\r\nHas the quality of care and patient feedback changed since NaDIA 2010? \r\n\r\nThe audit takes place every year in autumn. NaDIA 2011 was carried out by diabetes teams in acute hospitals in England on a nominated day in the first two weeks of October\r\n\r\n",
