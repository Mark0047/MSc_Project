        "notes": "In March 2010, the Scottish CCS (Carbon Capture & Storage) Consortium began an extensive Front End, Engineering and Design (FEED) study to assess what would be required from an engineering, commercial and regulatory, perspective in order to progress the CCS demonstration project at Longannet Power station in Scotland through to construction. The study yielded invaluable knowledge and the resulting material are available for download here. The UK Government's basic premise for financially supporting CCS demonstration is to facilitate further commercial scale CCS projects in the UK and internationally. DECC have made knowledge transfer activities a key requirement of the UKCCS Demonstration Competition. The Consortium identified stakeholder groups particularly relevant for knowledge transfer activities. Stakeholders were categorised in terms of: Knowledge needs; Potential to influence CCS deployment; Experience/ expertise they can bring to demonstration knowledge; Potential to disseminate demonstration knowledge; The assessment identified six priority audience groups: Academics, Environmental NGOs, Finance and Insurance, Industry, Initiatives and Developers and Regulatory and Policy. The Stakeholder Profiling Interviews sought to answer the following questions: Who are the key CCS stakeholders? What information are these stakeholders interested in from a CCS demonstration? What are the preferred methods for key stakeholders to receive and access information? Are the key stakeholders interested in interacting with CCS demonstrations, and if so, what is the preferred method to facilitate this interaction? This section of the FEED Close Out Report combines over 30 stakeholder interviews, with examples of knowledge transfer leading practice. Other FEED workstreams considered wider stakeholder engagement, for example, local community engagement and public communication. The appropriate summary section from the Feed Close Out Report can be downloaded as a PDF (Stakeholder profiling.pdf). The main text of the FEED Close Out Report, together with the supporting appendix for this section can be downloaded as PDF files.
