        "notes": "This temperature and precipitation data in csv format complements 13 other datasets as part of a study that compared ancient settlement patterns with modern environmental conditions in the Jazira region of Syria.\n\nThis study examined settlement distribution and density patterns over the past five millennia using archaeological survey reports and French 1930s 1:200,000 scale maps to locate and map archaeological sites. An archaeological site dataset was created and compared to and modelled with soil, geology, terrain (contour), surface and subsurface hydrology and normal and dry year precipitation pattern datasets; there are also three spreadsheet datasets providing 1963 precipitation and temperature readings collected at three locations in the region. The environmental datasets were created to account for ancient and modern population subsistence activities, which comprise barley and wheat farming and livestock grazing.\n\nThese environmental datasets were subsequently modelled with the archaeological site dataset, as well as, land use and population density datasets for the Jazira region. Ancient trade routes were also mapped and factored into the model, and a comparison was made to ascertain if there was a correlation between ancient and modern settlement patterns and environmental conditions; the latter influencing subsistence activities.\n\nThese temperature and precipitation data were transferred to and processed in a spreadsheet to generate bar graph to display evapotranspiration (ETP) rate for Dayr az-Zawr, Syria. Purpose was to show differences in evapotranspiration rates between the south, middle and north of the Jazira; higher ETP rates occur in the south near Dayr az-Zawr.",
