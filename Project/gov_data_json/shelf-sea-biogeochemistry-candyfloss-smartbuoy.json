        "notes": "This data set consists of biogeochemical sensor data from SmartBuoy moorings \n(Mills et al, 2005). SmartBuoys consist of a 4 meter tall stainless steel \nframe with a fibreglass torroid for buoyancy. Instruments are attached at a \nnominal 1 meter depth to the frame. In-air sensors are mounted to the top of \nthe torroid. The buoys feature a satellite telemetry system providing near \nreal-time telemetry. Temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, \nfluorescence, turbidity and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) sensors were \nfitted to a Cefas ESM2 data logger. These instruments gathered data for 5 \nminutes every 30 minutes. Sensors were validated against in-situ samples \nduring deployment and recovery. The buoy was also fitted with a water sampler \nwhich took periodic samples into pre-spiked (HgCl2) bags for later nutrient \nanalysis. The in-situ salinity and nutrients samples are quality controlled \nvia the Quality Assurance for Marine Environmental Measurements (QUASIMEME) \nscheme.\n\nPAR sensors were calibrated against a standard lamp.Fluorometers were \nstandardised using fluorosphere beads.Turbidity meters were calibrated using \nStabical (Hach, US).\n\nThis mooring was also fitted with a thermistor string (multiple temperature \nsensors at various depth), this data is held by BODC.",
