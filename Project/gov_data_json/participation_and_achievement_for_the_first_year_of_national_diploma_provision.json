        "notes": "These tables show early statistics on participation and achievement in Diploma learning during the first year of the Diploma programme. The Diploma is a new qualification which was introduced in schools and colleges in the academic year 2008/09 with an initial choice of five subjects, known as lines of learning. They can be taken by any pupil from the age of 14 and are available at different levels from Foundation (equivalent to 5 GCSEs at grades D-G), Higher (7 GCSEs at grades A*-C), Progression (2.5 A levels) and Advanced (3.5 A levels). At all levels the Diploma incorporates a mixture of practical experience and classroom learning. The majority of the Diplomas are taken over two years but some learners can choose to take a Diploma in one year.\r\n\r\nSource: Department for Children Schools and Families (DCSF) from Diploma Aggregation System (DAS) and National Pupil Database\r\n\r\nPublisher: Department for Children Schools and Families (DCSF)\r\n\r\nGeographies: County/Unitary Authority, Government Office Region (GOR), National\r\n\r\nGeographic coverage: England\r\n\r\nTime coverage: 2008/09\r\n\r\nType of data: Administrative data\r\n\r\nNotes: The figures come from the Diploma Aggregation System (DAS), which measures the number of learners registered on a Diploma course.
