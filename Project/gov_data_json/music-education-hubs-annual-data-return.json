There are currently 123 music education hubs funded across 2012 to 2015.  The return provides information on the impact of hubs' music education grants in terms of subsidising activities which support the core roles of the National Plan for Music Education  for the most recent Academic year.  This includes, for example, the number of maintained schools engaging with the hub, the numbers of pupils provided with free first access to music education and the numbers of ensembles and choirs organised by the hubs.  A report on the data will be produced for publication.\n\n",
