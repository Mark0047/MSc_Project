        "notes": "Earnings data is taken from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE). This is based on a 1 per cent sample of employee jobs. Information on earnings is obtained in confidence from employers. It does not cover the self-employed nor does it cover employees not paid during the reference period. Information is as at April each year. The statistics used are workplace based full-time individual earnings.\r\nHM Land Registry house price data is for the first half of the year only, so it is comparable to the ASHE data which is as at April.\r\nThe 'lower quartile' property price/income is determined by ranking all property prices/incomes in ascending order. The lowest 25 per cent of prices are below the lower quartile; the highest 75 per cent are above the lower quartile.\r\nThe 'median' property price/income is determined by ranking all property prices/incomes in ascending order. The point at which one half of the values are above and one half are below is the median.",
