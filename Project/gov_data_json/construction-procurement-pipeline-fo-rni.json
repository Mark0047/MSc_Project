        "notes": "The pipeline document is designed to complement information provided on the ISNI Information Portal (www.isni.gov.uk).  \r\n\r\n\u2022 The ISNI Information Portal provides a wide range of information on construction projects (and their underpinning procurements) under the Executive\u2019s Investment Strategy for Northern Ireland.  With effect from May 2015, all bodies covered by NI Public Procurement Policy are required to maintain detailed information on infrastructure developments, including procurement information, on the ISNI Information Portal.  This requirement is set out in Procurement Guidance Note PGN 02/15 (see link below).  \r\n\r\n\u2022 The pipeline differs from the Information Portal in two ways.  Firstly, it has a focus on procurement opportunities that have not yet been tendered (i.e. only pre-procurement).  Secondly, the pipeline document provides a longer-term view of potential deal flow and broad estimates of the timing of procurement opportunities over that term. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Procurement opportunities within the pipeline encompass both construction works and construction related services (e.g. design).  \r\n",

Digital NI aims to help establish a culture within Northern Ireland that develops and enhances Digital capability not just through interactions with Government, but also with local companies and throughout communities. Within government the Digital Transformation Service is facilitating this cultural shift through a number of methods, transforming Government services, making data open and available and encouraging and coaching those who lack digital skills.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised that opening up our data is the right thing to do in terms of transparency, accountability and efficiency of the Public Sector in Northern Ireland. It has the potential to encourage new commercial opportunities and drive economic growth and innovation across public and private sectors.",
