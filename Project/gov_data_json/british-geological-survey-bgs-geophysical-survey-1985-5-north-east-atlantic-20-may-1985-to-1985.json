        "notes": "This British Geological Survey (BGS) marine geophysical survey took place in May 1985 in the NE Rockall Trough on board the MV Gorsethorn. The purpose was to collect data as part of the UK continental shelf survey programme. The objectives were to acquire gravity, magnetic and shallow airgun data along the tracks of earlier deep seismic lines. Sea floor data were collected using echosounder. Sub-bottom seismic profiling data were collected using Airgun and Sparker (test lines). Gravity and Magnetometer data were also recorded. These records are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS report WB/89/10R.",
