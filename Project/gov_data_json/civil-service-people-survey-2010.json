In 2010 325,000 Civil Servants across 103 organisations participated.\r\n\r\nThe CSPS is delivered through a single procurement exercise that replaces over 100 separate exercises cutting the cost of staff surveys in the Civil Service by over 40% since 2008.\r\n\r\nIt provides consistent and robust metrics which help us understand how we can improve levels of engagement across the Civil Service.\r\n\r\nThe 2010 survey was carried out between mid-September 2010 and the end of October 2010; see the temporal details below for the start and end of fieldwork.\r\n\r\nThe linked files provide for each of the 103 participating organisations their Employee Engagement Index, theme % positive scores, and % positive (strongly agree or agree) scores for each of the core attitudinal questions asked to all respondents. A formatted (XLS) and unformatted (CSV) version is available.\r\n",
