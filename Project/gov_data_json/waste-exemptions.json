        "notes": "This dataset contains a summary of numbers of exemptions by paragraph type and a detailed site list for England.\n\nA simple waste registration or exemption is a waste operation that is exempt from needing an environmental permit. Each exemption has limits and conditions that must be followed. If an operator cannot meet the limits and conditions of an exemption, they may need to apply for an environmental permit.\n\nIt\u2019s free to register waste exemptions, and registration lasts for 3 years. The exception is the T11 WEEE exemption, which covers repairing or refurbishing waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). \n\nWaste exemptions are listed in 4 categories:\n\nUsing waste (exemptions U1 to U16): These cover operations such as using waste in construction, spreading waste materials on the land, and burning of waste as fuel.\n\nDisposing of waste (exemptions D1 to D8): These cover operations such as depositing sanitary waste, agricultural waste and spoil from dredging inland waters, and burning specific waste in an incinerator or in the open.\n\nStoring waste (exemptions S1 to S3): These cover the storage of certain waste materials in secure containers, at secure sites and storing sludge.\n\nTreating waste (exemptions T1 to T33): These cover operations such as preparing, recovering, sorting and treating certain waste materials, such as waste wood and plant matter.\n\nINFORMATION WARNING\nThe source Waste Exemptions dataset is updated every day but an extract is taken quarterly.
