Council tax can be measured in 'Band D' or in 'per dwelling' terms. Band D has historically been used as the standard for comparing council tax levels between and across local authorities, as this measure is not affected by the varying distribution of properties in bands that can be found across authorities. This is the council tax payable on a Band D dwelling occupied as a main residence by two adults, before any reductions due to discounts, exemptions or council tax benefit. This definition is widely regarded as a benchmark when comparing council tax levels in different areas or over time.\r\nBilling authorities are the 326 authorities (354 before 1 April 2009) that are empowered to set and collect council taxes, and manage a Collection Fund, on behalf of themselves and other local authorities in their area. In England, district councils (metropolitan and shire), the Council of the Isle of Scilly, unitary authorities, London boroughs, and the City of London are billing authorities. \r\nSource name: Communities and Local Government\r\nCollection name: Council tax levels set by local authorities\r\nPolarity: No polarity\r\n",
