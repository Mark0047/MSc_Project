This is in support of the Coalition Government's data transparency agenda, making data more accessible to the general public. The information to be published provides details on how schools spend their money and will help schools and others compare the extent to which they deliver value for money. It will also equip parents with the information they need to ask questions of schools. The data will be published online (via the Department for Education website) in downloadable tables and will also include headline Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 4 performance indicators.",
