        "notes": "This spatial dataset is an output of the Natural England County & City Natural Capital Atlas project (July 2020). It shows variation in ecosystem service flow for habitats across England, based on indicators identified by NE in the 2018 Natural Capital Indicators project. The dataset comprises a hexagonal grid which summarises indicator values across the country (each unit = 5km\u00b2).  \n\nNatural Capital is an important aspect of current environmental policy and management. This dataset, in combination with the other project outputs, will support understanding of Natural Capital in England and serve as a valuable engagement tool to communicate concepts of the Natural Capital approach to a wide variety of stakeholders.\n\nFor full methodology and user guide see documents \u2018NCAtlas_Devon\u2019 and \u2018NC-Mapping-User-Guidance\u2019 at http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/6672365834731520.\n\nFor full metadata documentation see the data package download below.\n\nCopyright statement:\nLCM2015 \u00a9 NERC (CEH) 2011.
