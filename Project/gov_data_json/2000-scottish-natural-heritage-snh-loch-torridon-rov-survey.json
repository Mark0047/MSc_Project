        "notes": "Dataset used in the NatureScot Commissioned Report 536 - Biological analyses of underwater video from research cruises in the Clyde Sea, Loch Torridon and the Inner Sound, North Minch, Loch Eriboll and Orkney. To help target marine nature conservation in Scotland, SNH and JNCC have generated a focused list of habitats and species of importance in Scottish waters - the Priority Marine Features (PMFs). A subset of these features (termed MPA search features) will drive the identification of Nature Conservation MPAs. The principal aim of the present investigation was to improve knowledge of the occurrence and distribution of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance in Scottish waters, especially PMFs, but also taking into consideration other importance measures. This was to be achieved through the analysis of seabed video and still photographic imagery collected during research cruises around Scotland carried out by various organisations between 2000 and 2012. \n     This dataset is from an ROV survey of habitats at 35 sites in Loch Torridon carried out in August 2000. Still images were used to describe the nature of the seabed, in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages.  Species present were, as far as possible, identified and quantified using the semi-quantitative MNCR SACFOR scale (Hiscock, 1996).  Based on the physical and biological attributes, biotopes were allocated (Connor et al., 2004).  Runs traversing a sequence of biotopes were split into corresponding segments, with the transition points recorded using the time.  Segmentation of runs was not practicable in the case of mosaics of recurring biotopes, in which case all biotopes observed were simply listed.  Runs and run segments were assessed for the presence of PMFs, as well as for the presence of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance according to a number of additional criteria. Species SACFOR data, habitat descriptions, biotopes, depth and positional data have been incorporated into the Marine Recorder repository.",
