        "notes": "This archaeological dataset complements 13 other datasets as part of a study that compared ancient settlement patterns with modern environmental conditions in the Jazira region of Syria. \n\nThis study examined settlement distribution and density patterns over the past five millennia using archaeological survey reports and French 1930s 1:200,000 scale maps to locate and map archaeological sites. An archaeological site dataset was created and compared to and modelled with soil, geology, terrain (contour), surface and subsurface hydrology and normal and dry year precipitation pattern datasets; there are also three spreadsheet datasets providing 1963 precipitation and temperature readings collected at three locations in the region. The environmental datasets were created to account for ancient and modern population subsistence activities, which comprise barley and wheat farming and livestock grazing. \n\nThese environmental datasets were subsequently modelled with the archaeological site dataset, as well as, land use and population density datasets for the Jazira region. Ancient trade routes were also mapped and factored into the model, and a comparison was made to ascertain if there was a correlation between ancient and modern settlement patterns and environmental conditions; the latter influencing subsistence activities.\n\nThis archaeological dataset was generated to show settlement distribution patterns in the Jazira region of Syria. The sites were mapped using publications of surveys conducted and the French 1:200,000 maps. The French maps include the identification of sites using toponyms called 'Tells'. The temporal extent of the archaeological sites in this dataset span from the Neolithic to Islamic periods of Syria.\n\nThe extent of the archaeological site dataset comprises an area within the Syrian Jazira, which lies between the Syrian and Turkish border in the north; the Syrian and Iraqi border to the east, including the River Tigris; and to the River Euphrates to the south and west. All related data collected was confined within this area with the exception of this archaeological dataset. Archaeological sites were identified and mapped along both banks of the River Euphrates. \n\nThere are 1,694 archaeological associated with this dataset.",
