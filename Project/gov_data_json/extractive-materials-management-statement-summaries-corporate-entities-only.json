        "notes": "This record is for Approval for Access product AfA203. Extractive Materials Management Statements are sent in by operators of mines and quarries to demonstrate that extractive materials produced on site are not extractive waste and therefore do not require a permit under the Environmental Permitting Regulations (EPR) to manage this material as would otherwise be required under the Mining Waste Directive. Specific information is required in an EMMS, to include what type of materials are produced, how the material is incorporated in the final site restoration and an estimate of the total quantity of materials produced during the lifetime of the operation. \nThis can be given by referencing existing information required under other legislation, for example Planning Permission.   EMMS are not submitted under any legislative framework, but are submitted as a result of an agreement between ourselves and the mines and quarries sector as a way of stating what materials are not extractive waste due to European Court of Justice rulings that define extractive waste in a more restrictive way that the Directive.\nThe EMMS spreadsheet holds summary details of all EMMS submitted to us since September 2010.\nSubsequent requests for individual EMM Statements  themselves will be treated on an individual basis, and will be checked for relevant confidentialities, in accordance with normal procedures.
