        "notes": "Making clinical audit data transparent \r\n\r\nIn his transparency and open data letter to Cabinet Ministers on 7 July 2011, the Prime Minister made a commitment to make clinical audit data available from the national audits within the National Clinical Audit and Patient Outcomes Programme. \r\n\r\nThe information available from this webpage comes from the National Bowel Cancer Audit. The Audit covers Strategic Clinical Networks and NHS Trusts in England and Wales. \r\n\r\nWhat information is being made available? \r\n\r\n\uf0a7 Audit participation by NHS Trust and data completeness for the key fields \r\n\r\n\uf0a7 Measures about the process of care given to patients \r\n\r\n\uf0a7 Information about care outcomes and treatment. \r\n\r\nThese data do not list individual patient information nor do they contain any patient identifiable data. \r\n\r\nUsing and interpreting the data \r\n\r\nData from the National Bowel Cancer Audit requires careful interpretation, and the information should not be looked at in isolation when assessing standards of care. \r\n\r\nData are provided by place of surgery in secondary care for the period 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015. Tertiary cancer centres that mainly provide oncological treatment for bowel cancer patients have been excluded from some measures, such as case ascertainment, as their patients would typically be diagnosed elsewhere. \r\n\r\nAccessing the data \r\n\r\nThe data are being made available on the data.gov website. Each year files of data from the National Bowel Cancer Audit will be made available in CSV format. Trusts and Networks are identified by name and their national code. \r\n\r\nWhat does the data cover? \r\n\r\nThe data measure levels of completeness for data submitted to the National Bowel Cancer Audit and measures of performance in the audit at trust level for key performance measures for assessing standards of care for bowel cancer in secondary care. Details of the methodology can be found in the second chapter of the National Bowel Cancer Audit Report 2016. \r\n\r\nAre all Trusts included? \r\n\r\nAll Trusts in England that manage patients diagnosed with bowel cancer are included. \r\n\r\nWhat period does the data cover? \r\n\r\nThis data covers patients with a date of diagnosis between 1 April 2014 and 31 March 2015. Specific data measures may apply to a more relevant subgroup of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer. ",
