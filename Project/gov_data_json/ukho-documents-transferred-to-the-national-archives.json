This is an ongoing process and the following types have been transferred:\r\n1. Hydrographic charts and surveys held by the UKHO that were accumulated before 1826 are being catalogued and transferred. Those that have been sent to Kew are listed under the 'Charts and Surveys Transferred' tab, along with their date of transfer. These can be ordered at Kew using their catalogue and have been allocated the class number ADM 352.\r\n2. Coastal views that were placed into albums before 1960 have been transferred. Those that have been sent to Kew are listed under the 'Coastal Views Transferred' tab. These can be ordered at Kew using their catalogue and have been allocated the class number ADM 344.\r\n3. Ships' remark books that were returned to the Admiralty from the 1750s to 1784 have been catalogued and transferred. Those that have been sent to Kew are listed under the 'Remark Books Transferred' tab, along with their date of transfer. These can be ordered at Kew using their catalogue and have been allocated the class number ADM 346",
