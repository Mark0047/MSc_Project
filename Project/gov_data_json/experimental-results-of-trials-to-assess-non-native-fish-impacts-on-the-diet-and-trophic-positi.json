        "notes": "These data derive from experiments carried out during the spring and summer \nmonths of two successive years (2014 and 2015) in outdoor experimental ponds \npreviously situated in East Sussex. The aim of the experiments was to \ndetermine whether or not introduced non-native fish species have an adverse \nimpact on the diet and trophic position of native pond fishes. The \nexperimental set up was more or less identical in both years, the study \nspecies in 2014 being the North American centrarchid (freshwater sunfish), \npumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus, whereas in 2015 the study species was the \ncyprinid fish native to Continental Europe, the sunbleak Leucaspius \ndelineatus.",
