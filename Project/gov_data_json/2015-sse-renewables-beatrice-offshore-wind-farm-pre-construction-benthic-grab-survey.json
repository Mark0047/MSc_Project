        "notes": "A pre-construction benthic characterisation survey was conducted by APEM Ltd at the proposed Beatrice Offshore Wind Farm (OWF) and Annex 1 Habitat Survey of the Offshore Transmission Works (OfTW) cable corridor (APEM ref 413984, client ref ED518) between the 22nd and the 27th June 2015. \n      The aim of the survey was to collect grab samples that will provide baseline data on the benthic ecology and sediment composition within the OWF area. Additionally the survey was to utilise Drop Down Video (DDV) to determine the presence of potential cobble reef Annex 1 habitats (EC Habitats Directive) the OfTW cable export corridor and investigate sites of potential archaeological importance within both the OWF area and export route.\n      Twelve grab stations were selected to provide representative coverage of the SS.SCS.ICS.MoeVen (Moerella spp. with venerid bivalves in infralittoral gravelly sand) biotope that was identified as being of high importance in the Beatrice OWF Environmental Statement and Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement and is representative of the Tide-swept coarse sands with burrowing bivalves Priority Marine Feature. Ten of the stations were located within the OWF boundary, with two reference stations located to the north east of the OWF. All stations corresponded to locations that were sampled during the EIA baseline characterisation study undertaken in 2010 (CMACS, 2011). At each of the twelve locations three replicate samples were acquired using a 0.1m2 Hamon grab. Each replicate was then sub-sampled for both macrofauna and Particle Size Analysis (PSA).",
