Ground-truth sampling by grabs and underwater cameras (video & stills images). Multibeam bathymetry and backscatter collected opportunistically on transit between stations. Broadscale habitat (BSH) and habitat FOCI (Features of Conservation Interest) recorded at time of sampling and included in cruise/survey report. More in-depth interpretation to be made in a Post-Survey Site Report, following integrated assessment of acoustics and outputs from laboratory analysis of benthic samples. These data are archived with the Marine Environmental Data and Information Network (MEDIN) Data Archive Centres (DACs) including the British Geological Survey (BGS) DAC for geology and geophysics, The Archive for Marine Species and Habitats Data (DASSH) and the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO) bathymetry DAC. The full site data package including raw is also available on request from BGS.",
