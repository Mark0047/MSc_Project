        "notes": "*** THIS DATA IS UPDATED DAILY *** Basic information about the occupation. A property may consist of a single building or many buildings, associated with one or many holdings.  A holding should have at least one occupation record relating to the holding owner. If there is more than one occupier then multiple occupation records may exist.\r\n\r\nThe \u2018Occupation\u2019 dataset provides key information about the tenant of each property, the amount of space that they occupy and the nature of that occupation.  As certain properties may have more than one tenant, there may be more than one entry in the data extract as government has more than one \u2018interest\u2019 in that property.  It should be noted that the list of tenants only includes government tenants. It does not include either commercial tenants or tenants from other parts of the public sector.  Again, the extract provides information about the \u2018owning\u2019 government department and the \u2018property centre\u2019, i.e. that part of the government department responsible for that property. In addition, it has a property reference (the \u2018ePIMS Property Ref\u2019) that allows it to be linked to the other data extracts.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the data includes land and property information for those government departments, together with any arms\u2019 length bodies for which they are responsible, including their non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs), which fall under the responsibility of English Ministers.  These assets are primarily located in England, but are also located in the devolved administrations of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales as well as overseas. \r\n\r\nAlso, some Local Authorities have chosen to publish their property data as part of our transparency exercise.",
