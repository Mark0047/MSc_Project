The aims were to \nexamine the drift, growth and mortality of herring larvae, as well as the \nvertical distribution of herring larvae in relation to water masses and \nmovement. Plankton samples were collected at each site on the survey grid. \nThis data consists of the numbers of larvae, along with associated positional \ndata and volumes filtered.",
