        "notes": "Average Standard Assessment Procedure energy rating score\n\n#### How the figure is calculated:\r\n\r\nThe sum of SAP energy rating scores for each new home for which an energy performance certificate has been issued in the reporting period, divided by the number of new homes for which a certificate has been issued.  It is the average of the large number of scores calculated for new dwellings during the reporting period.\r\n\r\n#### Why is this indicator in the business plan?\r\n\r\nThis is a key housing measure for which DCLG has policy responsibility. It monitors the energy efficiency of new build homes.\r\n\r\n#### How often is it updated?\r\n\r\nQuarterly\r\n\r\n####Where does the data come from?\r\n\r\nNational Energy Performance Certificate Register. Published figures are available [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government/series/code-for-sustainable-homes-statistics#publications)\r\n\r\n#### What area does the headline figure cover?\r\n\r\nEngland\r\n\r\n#### Are further breakdowns of the data available?\r\n\r\nYes, can be split by dwelling type. \r\n\r\n#### What does a change in this indicator show?\r\n\r\nAn increase in this indicator would show an average increase in the energy efficiency of new homes. The average SAP rating is expected to gradually rise over the long-term as a growing proportion of new homes are completed to the 2010 Building Regulations standard, which requires more energy efficient new homes.\r\n\r\n#### Time Lag\r\n\r\nPublished within two months of the end of the reporting period\r\n\r\n#### Next available update\r\n\r\nTo be confirmed.\r\n\r\n#### Type of Data\r\n\r\nOfficial Statistics.\r\n\r\n#### Robustness and data limitations\r\n\r\nAverage figures are volatile due to a number of factors including the small number of new homes being assessed, the mix of dwelling types, the mix of heating systems used in new developments and the location of those developments.\r\n\r\n#### Links to Further Information\r\n\r\n[https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government/series/code-for-sustainable-homes-statistics#publications](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government/series/code-for-sustainable-homes-statistics#publications)\r\n\r\n#### Contact Details\r\n\r\n[CorporatePerformance@communities.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:CorporatePerformance@communities.gsi.gov.uk)\r\n\r\n",
