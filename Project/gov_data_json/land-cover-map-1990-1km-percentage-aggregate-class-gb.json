        "notes": "This dataset consists of the 1km raster, percentage aggregate class version of the Land Cover Map 1990 (LCM1990) for Great Britain. The 1km percentage product provides the percentage cover for each of 10 aggregated land cover classes for 1km x 1km pixels. This product contains one band per aggregated habitat class (producing a 10 band image). The 10 aggregate classes are groupings of the 21 target classes, which are based on the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) Broad Habitats, which encompass the entire range of UK habitats. The aggregate classes group some of the more specialised classes into more general categories. For example, the five coastal classes in the target class are grouped into a single aggregate coastal class. This dataset is derived from the vector version of the Land Cover Map, which contains individual parcels of land cover and is the highest available spatial resolution. LCM1990 is a land cover map of the UK which was produced at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology by classifying satellite images (mainly from 1989 and 1990) into 21 Broad Habitat-based classes. It is the first in a series of land cover maps for the UK, which also includes maps for 2000, 2007, 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2019. LCM1990 consists of a range of raster and vector products and users should familiarise themselves with the full range (see related records, the UK CEH web site and the LCM1990 Dataset documentation) to select the product most suited to their needs. This work was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council award number NE/R016429/1 as part of the UK-SCAPE programme delivering National Capability.
