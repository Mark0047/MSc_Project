The samples are deformed sinusoidally at strains of up to 5 mimcrostrain and periods from 10s to 360s \u2013 10 frames of images were collected per cycle for a total of 1000 frames. Data collected at NSLS X17B2 using the deformation-DIA press until its closure, thereafter collected at the replacement beamline at APS using the same press. These data are currently being prepared for publication. Similar images were collected on polycrystalline San Carlos Olivine samples either dry or wet to investigate the effect of water on grain boundary strength and the data are also archived here.",
