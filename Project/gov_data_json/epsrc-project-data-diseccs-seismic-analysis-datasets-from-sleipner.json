Grids (in spreadsheet form) of interpreted parameters from the 3D time-lapse seismics (temporal and constructed depth thicknesses) at the Sleipner CO2 storage operation in the North Sea. 2. A synthetic seismic model of a CO2 wedge, to examine the relationship between wedge true thickness and temporal thicknesses. These datasets underpin following publications: Chadwick, R.A., Williams, G.A. & White, J.C. 2016. High resolution imaging and characterisation of a CO2 layer at the Sleipner CO2 Storage operation using time-lapse seismics. First Break, 34, 79-87. The source data comprise the Sleipner 3D time-lapse surveys which were acquired in 1994 (baseline), 1999, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010. The dataset used here for measuring temporal thicknesses is the 2010 high resolution dataset with constructed depth thicknesses from the 1994 baseline data. Grant number: EP/K035878/1.",
