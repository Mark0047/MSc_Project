        "notes": "      Runoff Attenuation Features Potential is our best estimate of locations of high flow accumulation across the land surface or in smaller channels, where it may be possible to temporarily store water and attenuate flooding during high flows. The dataset is designed to support signposting of areas to target enhanced storage. It is based upon the Risk of Flooding from Surface Water datasets and identifies areas of high flow accumulations for the 3.3% Annual Exceedance Probability surface water maps. The areas of ponding or accumulation are between 100 and 5000 metres squared, and have been tagged where they fall on an area of slope steeper than 6% as gully blocking opportunities. All the potential areas have been constrained so that they are not in urban areas or on roads, rails or canal\r\ns.\r\n\r\n    ",
