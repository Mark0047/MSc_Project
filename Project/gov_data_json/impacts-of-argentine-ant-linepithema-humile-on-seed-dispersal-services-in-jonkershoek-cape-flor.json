        "notes": "This dataset describes the seed dispersal process of both invaded (presence of Linepithema humile) and non-invaded (absence of L. humile) ant communities. Data were collected from Jonkershoek Nature Reserve (33\u00b055'51\"S, 18\u00b051'16\"E) in South Africa, during the summer months of 2014 (November-December), 2015 (January-February), and 2017 (January-February). - Experiment 1: Ant community structure of both invaded and non-invaded ant communities was determined using a series of pitfall and baiting traps. - Experiment 2: Ant communities were presented with seeds (from twelve plant species) via a cafeteria setup and the rate of removal was measured over three hours. - Experiment 3: Seeds were presented to nests of both the invasive L. humile and six native ant species, after 24 hours nests were cast with dental plaster and excavated. The seeds were retrieved, and their burial depths were recorded. Data were collected from all three experiments to test hypothesis about the dispersal ability of the dominant seed dispersing ant species in both invaded and non-invaded ant communities. Funding was received from a NERC-Case studentship (NE/K007076/1) and Varley-Gradwell Travelling Fellowship.
