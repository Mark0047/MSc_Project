It also collects data on those staff members employed centrally by the local authority but who spend the majority of their time working in schools.\r\nThe School Workforce Census collects information about individual teachers, teaching assistants and other school staff and some information about the schools themselves, such as the number of teaching vacancies. The individual information collected includes characteristics of staff, gender and ethnicity etc., types of contract and how they are deployed on full or part time, permanent, roles and responsibilities, salary details, sickness absence details, qualifications held and for a sample of secondary schools the curriculum taught.\r\nThe School Workforce Census is collected on an annual basis in November and was first collected in 2010. Prior to this teacher data was collected on an annual basis in January in aggregate form from Local Authorities and schools.",

In April each year a comprehensive set of headlne statistics for England are published in the 'School Workforce in England' series of first releases: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-school-workforce\r\n\r\nIn the following July we then release, at the same link, a series of school level school workforce indicators. \r\n \r\nThe Secretary of State can share the raw data (which is held by DfE) under strict terms and conditions with named bodies and third parties.   This has provided invaluable evidence on education to inform independent research, as well as studies commissioned by the Department.\r\n\r\nAccess is subject to requesters complying with terms and conditions imposed under contractual arrangements and a rigorous accreditation process. To request access please contact the teachers and teaching statistics team at SchoolWorkforce.STATISTICS@education.gsi.gov.uk\r\nThe most current data is from the November 2013 school workforce census which was published in April 2014.  The 2013 school level data is to be published in July 2014."
