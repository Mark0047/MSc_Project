The purpose was to collect data as part of a regional mapping programme. Sea floor data were collected using Transit sonar. Seabed scintillation probe trials were carried out. Sample data were collected using vibrocorer; gravity corer; rock gravity corer; rock dredge and shipek grab. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in IGS report 73/14.",
