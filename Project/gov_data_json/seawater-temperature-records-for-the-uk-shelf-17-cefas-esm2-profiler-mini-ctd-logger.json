        "notes": "This dataset has been extracted as part of an exercise to assemble \"all\" Cefas \nTemperature Data and publish it in a Data paper. It is one of 17 Cefas data \nsources assembled. ESM2 is a Cefas developed micro logger for applications \nrequiring a small low power logger with integrated sensors and battery. It has \nstandard sensors for conductivity, temperature, depth, optical backscatter and \nroll &amp; pitch. Data are saved compact flash cards which are easily removed \nfor rapid data transfer. It was initially developed to be a handheld profiler \nthat could be used from small boats and/or when a conventional large rosette \ncouldn't be used. It is now used routinely in place of traditional CTD \nequipment e.g. on SmartBuoy related work and, because it also accommodates \noptional sensors, it is widely used on RV Cefas Endeavour research cruises, \nproviding profiles of the water column for plankton and fisheries work. The \ntemperature sensor used is an FSI CT model.",
