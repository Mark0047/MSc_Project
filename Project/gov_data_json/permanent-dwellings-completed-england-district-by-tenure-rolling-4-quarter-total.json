        "notes": "This data set contains rolling four quarter totals (England only) on house building completions. From 2011/12 imputed data is included. Imputed data should not be seen as an estimate for the individual authority but is given on an authority basis to allow custom totals to be constructed. A dwelling is regarded as complete when it becomes ready for occupation or when a completion certificate is issued.\n\nEngland total figures include estimates for missing data returns from independent Approved Inspectors and Local Authorities, so the sum of district values may be slightly less than the England totals.\r\n\r\nHouse building completion \u2013 In principle, a dwelling is regarded as complete when it becomes ready for occupation or when a completion certificate is issued whether it is in fact occupied or not. In practice, the reporting of some completions may be delayed and some completions may be missed if no completion certificate was requested by the developer or owner, although this is unusual.\r\n \r\n\r\nThese data are derived from live table 253a, and rolling totals for England are calculated and published in Tables 2a and 2b of the house building statistics [release](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/house-building-statistics).",
