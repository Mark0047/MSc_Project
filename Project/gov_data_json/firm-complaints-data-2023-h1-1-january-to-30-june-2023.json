        "notes": "Financial firms provide data to the FCA every 6 months about the complaints they have received, what these were about and how they dealt with them. The FCA collects and publishes data at both an aggregate (market level) and firm specific, although only publishes firm specific data for firms reporting 500 or more complaints in a 6 month reporting period, or 1,000 or more complaints in an annual reporting period.\r\n\r\nThe FCA uses the complaints data to help assess how firms interact with and treat their customers as well as monitoring their performance over time. It also uses this data to guide its work in supervising firms and markets, highlighting any potential concerns with specific financial products offered.\r\n\r\n##Key findings include:\r\n\r\n* In 2023 H1, financial services firms received 1.88m opened complaints, an increase of 5% from 2022 H2 (1.80m).\r\n \r\n* The product groups that experienced an increase in their opened complaint numbers from 2022 H2 to 2023 H1 were the following: decumulation & pensions (20%), investments (18%), insurance & pure protection (6%), & banking and credit cards (3%).\r\n \r\n* The home finance product group saw a 10% reduction in opened complaints from 101,333 (2022 H2) to 91,469 (2023 H1).\r\n \r\n* Since 2016 H2, current accounts have remained the most complained about product. The number of current accounts opened complaints increased, from 500,371 in 2022 H2 to 509,923 in 2023 H1 (2%).",
