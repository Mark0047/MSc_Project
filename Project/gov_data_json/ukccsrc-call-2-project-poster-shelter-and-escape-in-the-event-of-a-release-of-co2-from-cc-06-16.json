        "notes": "This poster on the UKCCSRC Call 2 project Shelter and Escape in the Event of a Release of CO2 from CCS Infrastructure (S-CAPE) was presented at the CSLF Call project poster reception, London, 27.06.16. Grant number: UKCCSRC-C2-179. Pipelines are acknowledged as one of the most efficient and cost-effective methods for transporting large volumes of various fluids over long distances and therefore the majority of proposed schemes for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) involve high pressure pipelines transporting CO2. In order to manage the risk in the event of the failure of a carbon dioxide (CO2) pipeline, it is a core requirement that a separation distance between pipelines and habitable dwellings is defined to ensure a consistent level of risk. The aim of this project is to develop validated and computationally efficient shelter and escape models describing the consequences to the surrounding population of a CO2 release from CCS transportation infrastructure. The models will allow pipeline operators, regulators and standard setters to make informed and appropriate decisions regarding pipeline safety and emergency response. This poster presents some preliminary findings from the S-Cape project and: &bullet; Describes the development of analytical and Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) models to calculate the change in internal CO2 concentration within a building engulfed by a dispersing cloud of CO2. &bullet; Investigates the sensitivity of the CO2 concentration within a building to wind speed and the temperature of the CO2 in the pipeline. &bullet; Demonstrates how CFD models can be used to verify results obtained using computationally efficient analytical models.",
