        "notes": "The FCA analyses the data, from 1 January 2023 and 31 March 2023, resulting from action it has taken against authorised firms breaching financial promotion rules and referrals, and investigations into unregulated activity.\r\n\r\nThe data the FCA gathers means it can monitor developments in the market, get insights into sectors it has concerns about and act to prevent consumers from harm.\r\n\r\nThe latest data shows the FCA reviewed 539 financial adverts relating to authorised firms, and its engagement resulted in 2,235 promotions being amended or withdrawn. Retail lending (with 45%), and retail investments (45%) are the sectors with the highest amend/withdraw outcomes, amounting to just over 90% of the FCA's interventions with authorised firms.",
