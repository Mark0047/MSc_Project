        "notes": "The dataset includes results from laboratory experiments aiming to explore the reduction and polymerization potential of phosphorus under metamorphic conditions. Table 1 shows the initial composition of the starting materials, as well as the conditions under which those materials were heated to metamorphic temperatures. Table 2 shows the analytical results, including mineralogy and phosphorus speciation. The results show that phosphate polymerization occurs at moderate temperatures of a <100 to ca. 300 degrees whereas phosphate reduction increases with increasing temperature. The presence of metallic catalysts impacts both processes. The results imply that a diverse suite of phosphorus species can be created during metamorphism, which may explain previous reports of reduced phosphorus in high-grade metamorphic rocks. This is relevant for the origin of life, where such species may have been important precursors for phosphorylated biomolecules.",
