These samples were loaned to Cefas by ICES WGMEGS \nparticipating nations that collected the samples. The dataset consists of 551 \nsamples split across 6 different time periods with a total of 59,160 eggs of \nwhich 45,721 identified to 30 different taxa and 78,067 larvae of which 69,894 \nwere identified to 72 different taxonomic groups. Within the data set the date \nand time is recorded along with the latitude and longitude position. For each \nentry at maximum depth the profiler reached and the total volume of seawater \nfiltered (m3), calculated by flowmeters, is recorded for each record.",
