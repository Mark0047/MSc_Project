        "notes": "**This dataset has been superseded** The newGeoSure Insurance Product (newGIP) provides the potential insurance risk due to natural ground movement. It incorporates the combined effects of the 6 GeoSure hazards on (low-rise) buildings: landslides, shrink-swell clays, soluble rocks, running sands, compressible ground and collapsible deposits. The newGIP evaluates these hazards using a series of processes including statistical analyses and expert elicitation techniques to create a derived product that can be used for insurance purposes such as identifying and estimating risk and susceptibility. The newGIP is made up of 3 components. 1. Derived Postcode Database (DPD): this dataset contains generalised information at a postcode level and it\u2019s updated on a 6 monthly basis. The DPD is designed to provide a \u2018summary\u2019 value representing the combined effects of the GeoSure dataset across a postcode sector area. This product uses Code-Point\u00ae Open data to relate postcodes to Ordnance Survey grid references. This dataset is available in a range of GIS formats including Access (*.dbf), ArcGIS (*.shp) or MapInfo (*.tab). 2. Unified Hazards (Vector Dataset): This is a detailed vector dataset providing spatial GIS information that can be used for more specific analysis at a higher resolution (e.g. site/address specific at 1:50k resolution). This dataset also has additional attributes outlining the type and scale of the potential hazards at any one location. This dataset is updated with the release of each version of DiGMapGB-50 and is available in a range of GIS formats including ArcGIS (*.shp) or MapInfo (*.tab). 3. Unified Hazards (Gridded Dataset): This dataset consists of a raster grid derived from the vector dataset; however, due to the raster grid format, the grid only carries limited attribution. Data for the newGIP is provided for national coverage across Great Britain. The newGeoSure Insurance Product dataset is produced for use at 1:50 000 scale providing 50 m ground resolution.",
