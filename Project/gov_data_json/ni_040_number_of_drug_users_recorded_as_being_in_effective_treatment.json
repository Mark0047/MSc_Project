Drug users are regarded as in continuous treatment, if they move from one episode of treatment to another but where the time elapsed does not exceed 21 days from discharge at one agency to modality start date at a subsequent agency (inclusive of discharge and modality start date). Or where episodes run concurrently and a modality has commenced in the later episode.\n\nGuidelines: Good performance is typified by an increase in the number of drug users recorded as being in effective treatment.",
