        "notes": "The Index of Multiple Deprivation, which was produced at LSOA level in 2007 and 2004, combines seven distinct domains of deprivation together to give an overall impression of the level of deprivation experienced by an area. The health domain combines 4 indicators about a range of health issues to give an overall score for the level of health deprivation experienced in a small area. The indicators used in this domain are; - Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL) - Comparative Illness and Disability Ratio - Measures of acute morbidity, derived from Hospital Episode Statistics - The proportion of adults under 60 suffering from mood or anxiety disorders based on prescribing, suicide mortality rate and health benefits data More information about this domain can be found in Chapter 2, Section 4 of the English Indices of Deprivation 2007 report \r\nhttp://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919132719/http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/communities/pdf/733520.pdf",
