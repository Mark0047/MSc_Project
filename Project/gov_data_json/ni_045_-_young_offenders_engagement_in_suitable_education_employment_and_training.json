        "notes": "This indicator measures the proportion of known young offenders who are actively engaged in education, training and employment and the effectiveness of partnership arrangements between Youth Offending Teams (statutory local partnerships that include LAs) and their wider partnership arrangements with education authorities and providers.  Young offenders are defined as all those aged 10-17 on youth justice disposals. Active engagement is counted as at least 25 hours, (and those above statutory school age at least 16 hours), of Education, Employment and Training (EET) in the last full working week of the disposal. If the disposal closes during a holiday period, the last full working week before the holiday is counted. Hours planned for EET where the young person does not attend are not counted.\r\nSource: Youth Offending Team\r\nPublisher: DCLG Floor Targets Interactive\r\nGeographies: County/Unitary Authority, Government Office Region (GOR), National\r\nGeographic coverage: England\r\nTime coverage: 2003/04 to 2009/10\r\nType of data: Administrative data",
