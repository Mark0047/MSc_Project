        "notes": "During 2010-11, as part of the Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) Demonstration Competition process, E.ON undertook a Front End Engineering Design (FEED) study for the development of a commercial scale CCS demonstration plant at Kingsnorth in Kent, South East England. The study yielded invaluable knowledge and the resulting material is available for download here. This chapter presents the Health and Safety Reports produced during the current FEED stage. HAZID/ENVID studies were carried out for the following sections of the project: Kingsnorth Power Plant (impact on and from CCS); Kingsnorth CO2 capture and compression plant; CO2 Pipeline (On and Offshore); Kingsnorth CO2 Injection Platform; Wells and Reservoirs. The results of the HAZID studies for the power plant and capture and compression plant are recorded in the 'HAZID Report' and 'HAZID Report Addendum' in this Chapter. The pipeline and platform HAZID is in section 6 and the wells and reservoirs HAZID in section 7. Other reviews, such as SIMOPS (Simultaneous Operations) studies have been carried out. A review of Major Accident Hazards for the pipeline has been undertaken and the outcome is described in the report 'ALARP Review Report for Genesis Scope of Work'. Design Risk Assessments (DRAs) were carried out by the design teams, with support from the Safety Consultant. DRAs were qualitative rather than quantitative, due to the early stage of design within FEED. The DRAs are collated and summarised in the 'CDM Design Risk Register'. A draft Pre-Construction Safety Report has been produced to further inform the design process, and enhance our understanding of the significant hazards, both safety and environmental, associated with these processes. This overall approach to Health and Safety is set out in more detail in the 'Health and Safety Design Philosophy' Further supporting documents for chapter 8 of the Key Knowledge Reference Book can be downloaded.",
