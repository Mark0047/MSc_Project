        "notes": "      Water Framework Directive (WFD) Coastal Waterbodies is a polygon Shapefile dataset containing attributes that have been collated as defined for the implementation of the WFD. Article 2, clause 7 of the WFD defines coastal waterbodies as '...a surface water on the landward side of a line, every point of which is at a distance of one nautical mile on the seaward side from the nearest point of the baseline from which the breadth of territorial waters is measured, extending where appropriate up to the outer limit of transitional waters'. Since waterbodies are attributed with a unique identifier 'EA_WB_ID' this dataset can be linked directly to other WFD data sources such as physical characteristics, risk, classification and proposed objectives. This dataset covers the\r\n layer for Cycle 1 of the Water framework Directive (2008 - 2013). The equivalent layer for Cycle 2 is covered under WFD Coastal Waterbodies Cycle 2.\r\n\r\n    ",
