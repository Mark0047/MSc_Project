        "notes": "This report is a contribution to the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA4) conducted by the Department of Trade and Industry (now Department of Energy and Climate Change). The report describes the surficial sediments in the SEA4 area and the sedimentary processes that are active in the area at the present day. The report focuses on the deeper water areas from the outer continental shelf to the floor of the Norwegian Basin in the northernmost part of SEA4. The report is based on sidescan sonar images, multibeam bathymetry, sub-bottom profiles, seabed photographs and sediment samples. The Holocene and late glacial events and processes that contributed to the present day seafloor morphology and sediment distribution are reviewed, as is the present day oceanographic regime. It is concluded that the present day sedimentary environment, seaward of the continental shelf edge at about 200 m water depth, is dominated by low sediment input and deposition rates, and by reworking of surficial sediments by bottom currents. The large scale seabed morphology was shaped mainly during the last glacial, when high sediment input resulted in glacigenic debris fan formation.",
