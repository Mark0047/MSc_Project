WaveNet, Defra's strategic wave monitoring network for the \nUnited Kingdom, provides a single source of real-time wave data from a network \nof wave buoys located in areas at risk from flooding. In operation since 2002, \nWaveNet collects and processes data from the Cefas-operated Datawell \nDirectional Waverider buoys, tethered at strategic locations around the UK \ncoastline. The WaveNet system also gathers wave data from a variety of third \nparty platforms and programmes (industry and public sector-funded), all of \nwhich are freely available for visualisation on the WaveNet website: \nSignificant wave hight in metres, Water temperature in degree Celsius, \nDominant (peak) wave periods in seconds, Average (zero crossing) wave periods \nin second, Dominant (peak) wave directions in degrees, Wave spread in degrees, \nNotional sensor depth = 0.45m",
