        "notes": "As part of the Commonwealth Marine Economies Programme (CMEP) Cefas collected \n50 drop camera video tows of the seabed off the coast of Grand Anse Bay to St \nGeorge's, in Grenada, to characterise the benthic fauna within the area and \nsupport the creation of benthic habitat maps. The videos and still images were \nacquired during the 2016 survey using a lightweight drop camera frame with a \nSubC camera, two lasers for scaling images and additional lighting for real \ncolour images of the seabed. The drop camera frame was lowered to the seabed \nby hand from a vessel, with the video monitored to maintain a consistent \nheight above the seabed. Tows were 15 minutes long with the vessel drifting in \nneutral so the distance covered in each tow varied. Sample depths ranged from \n5-60 m and covered a range of habitats including bare sediment, seagrass, and \ncoral and sponge dominated reefs. Still images were acquired every minute at a \npoint when the seabed was clearly in focus.",
