        "notes": "The historic environment on Dartmoor is of great importance and value. Much of it is recognised to be of international significance and there are archaeological landscapes that rank amongst the finest in Europe. Fourteen such areas, described as Premier Archaeological Landscapes (PALs) have been identified. The main objective is to ensure that in these areas, when land management is under consideration, their historical significance is recognised and respected, whilst remaining sympathetic to the ecological interest. The PALs arose as part of the process of creating a Vision for Dartmoor\u2019s moorland in 2005.",
