        "notes": "NHS IT survey was circulated to NHS organisations between September and November 2011.\r\n\r\nThe survey was designed to collect high level data about systems and suppliers used within the NHS. Publishing this data in a transparent way aims to help:\r\n\r\n- inform national strategic planning in relation to management of key suppliers\r\n- inform local and regional strategy and decisions (e.g. to provide organisations with a good understanding of the wider NHS IT estate and to identify other organisations with similar estates/system dependencies to work together on issues of common interest)\r\n- support the development of widely used systems in the NHS;\r\n- enable information intermediaries to provide different insights to support the NHS as it continues to develop its capacity to exchange and provide information.\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing the spreadsheet please bear in mind that this is simply a consolidated report of the raw data received so far. Consequently, no data cleansing has been undertaken and not all of the fields have been completed by all respondents.\r\n\r\n",
