        "notes": "A collection of reference drawings relating to investigations carried out by Nirex, during the period from 1989 to 1997. The drawings summarise the status of the geological investigation at Sellafield and include borehole locations, geology (surface, structure, sections etc) and geophysics (seismic, airborne, etc). Sites near Sellafield, in Cumbria, and Dounreay, in Caithness. The Nirex (Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Executive) geological archive was transferred to the British Geological Survey during 2000/2001. The BGS has undertaken to retain the records for a minimum of 50 years as part of its national geological archive. The ownership of Nirex was transferred from the nuclear industry to the UK Government departments DEFRA and DTI in April 2005, and then to the UK's Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) in November 2006.",
