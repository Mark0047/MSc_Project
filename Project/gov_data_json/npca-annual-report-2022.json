The participation of NHS providers and the completeness and quality of the data submitted to the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS), NHS Digital and the Wales Cancer Network, Public Health Wales.\r\n\r\n2. Patient demographic information and key aspects of the diagnostic and staging process they underwent and the treatments they received.\r\n\r\n3. Treatment outcomes (up to two years post-treatment) for men in England and Wales undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) or radical external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in 2018-2019.\r\n\r\n4. The variation in treatment for men with low-risk, localised disease and high-risk/locally advanced disease in Wales only.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we also present:\r\n\r\n5. The ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the diagnosis of prostate cancer, receipt of radical treatment and systemic therapy in England in 2021.\r\n\r\n6.
