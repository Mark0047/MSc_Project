        "notes": "This British Geological Survey (BGS) regional marine geophysical and sampling survey (comprised of two legs) took place from September to October 1976 in North Sea and the Minch on board the RRS Challenger. The purpose was to gather data which could be used to map the regional geology of the area and investigate Pockmarks between the Forties and Piper oilfields (Leg 1), to recover solid rock from outcrops on the west coast of Scotland using Consub (Leg 2). Seabed samples and cores were collected using Shipek grab, Gravity corer and unmanned submersible Consub. Sea floor data were collected using a echo-sounder, side-scan sonar, acoustic and resistivity probes. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS Internal Report 76/8.",
