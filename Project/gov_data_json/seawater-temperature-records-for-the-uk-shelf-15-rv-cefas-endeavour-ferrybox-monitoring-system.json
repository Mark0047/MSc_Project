        "notes": "This dataset has been extracted as part of an exercise to assemble \"all\" Cefas \nTemperature Data and publish it in a Data paper. It is one of 17 Cefas data \nsources assembled. Ferryboxes are packages of instruments that are usually \nplaced on board commercial ships such as ferries to monitor temperature, \nsalinity and other water properties. This data series is from 2009-2013 from \nthe cruises of the RV Cefas Endeavour. The RV Cefas Endeavour was commissioned \nin 2003 and fitted with a FerryBox system in 2009. Unlike most FerryBox \nsystems (see `http://www.ferrybox.org`_ and \n`http://noc.ac.uk/ocean\u2013watch/shallow\u2013coastal\u2013seas/ferrybox`_), RV Cefas \nEndeavour runs a combination of regular (usually annual) monitoring cruises in \nUK Shelf waters (with a focus on ICES Mandated Surveys for fisheries \nassessments) and bespoke research cruises. This provides a widespread coverage \nwith some repeat components in time and space.\n\n\n\n\n.. _`http://www.ferrybox.org`:\n    http://www.ferrybox.org/\n\n.. _`http://noc.ac.uk/ocean\u2013watch/shallow\u2013coastal\u2013seas/ferrybox`:\n    http://noc.ac.uk/ocean-watch/shallow-coastal-seas/ferrybox",
