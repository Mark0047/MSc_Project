        "notes": "This set of data is the second set of impact interviews conducted with the target communities of the BRAVE project. The interviews are transcriptions in Microsoft word. The communities involved in the data collection were from Tomo and Poa in Burkina Faso and Jawani and Tariganga in Ghana. There are 32 interviews from Burkinabe community members, and 23 from the Ghanaian communities. Individuals were selected based on their participation in the BRAVE field activity of the Farmer Voice Radio. The data was collected between October 2019 and February 2020 by the local researchers. This data methodology was built on the initial vulnerability assessments, and include questions around behaviour change and income change based on the BRAVE communities activities of ground water measurement and water management strategies. This data shows behaviour and livelihood change within the communities and due to these activities. This is final qualitative impacts dataset from the BRAVE project. Previous linked data sets include the baseline vulnerability assessments and the first round of impact interviews. BRAVE: Building understanding of climate variability into planning of groundwater supplies from low storage aquifers in Africa BRAVE is a \u2018Consortium\u2019 research project is part of the UPGro (Unlocking the Potential of Groundwater for the Poor) programme.",
