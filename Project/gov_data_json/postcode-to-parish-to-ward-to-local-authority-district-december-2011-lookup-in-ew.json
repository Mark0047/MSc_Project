        "notes": "<span style='font-family: '>A lookup between 2011 Census enumeration postcodes for England and Wales, and the parishes / communities, wards and local authority districts as at 31 December 2011. Enumeration postcodes are a sub-Output Area (OA) geography used only for the publication of estimates of males, females and households in the 2011 Census. The enumeration postcodes are defined as only those valid unit postcodes that were recorded during the 2011 Census as containing usually resident population. Postcodes have been assigned using a \u2018point-in-polygon\u2019 methodology that plots each postcode's mean address (centroid) into the areas of each of the parishes / communities, wards and local authority districts (LAD). In England there is not a full coverage of parishes, so the 2011 Census enumeration postcodes that do not fall into a parish will have no parish allocation. There are also 23 parishes (0.2%) that do not contain any enumeration postcode centroids. This occurs where a parish contains population, but the centroid of the postcode falls outside the parish. In these instances it is not possible to allocate a postcode to the parish.</span>",
