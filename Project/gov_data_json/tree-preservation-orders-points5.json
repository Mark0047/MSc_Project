        "notes": "When the modern planning system was established under the Town and Country Planning Act 1947 local planning authorities retained their powers to protect trees and woodlands in the interests of amenity by making tree preservation orders. Over 50 years later tree preservation orders remain an important part of the system.  The current regulations that enable TPOs are the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, The Town and Country Planning (Tree Preservation)(England) Regulations 2012 which came into force on 6 Aril 2012.\n\nTPOs can be either very simple, covering just one tree or a small group of trees or they can be extremely complex and cover extensive areas including woodland.\n\nTrees can be designated in TPOs as an individual tree, a group of trees, an area of trees or as a woodland.  This dataset is point feature based and as such contains only individual trees.  Areas, groups and woodlands are covered in Tree Preservation Orders (Polygons) which is a polygon based dataset.\n\nThis dataset contains TPOs that have been confirmed as well as those that are still provisional.\n\nThe features and attributes contained in this dataset have been extracted from the UNI-form system which is the central repository for maintaining and creating TPOs. The dataset is updated on a weekly basis as new orders are being made and existing data updated on a regular basis.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: We are aware of some errors and omissions in the source database and these are being reviewed and corrected /updated on a regular basis. If data in a field is missing it does not mean that it is not available in the paper files. Occasionally data has been entered into the wrong field in the database. This will be amended as it comes to light. If you rely on this data as evidence that a tree is not protected then you should ensure that you have the most up to date dataset and you are advised to keep a copy of the evidence in case of a dispute. You are also advised to consider other tree protection issues in addition to Tree Preservation Orders. Details of Tree Protection can be found on the Council's website (www.cornwall.gov.uk)\n\nYou are urged to contact Cornwall Council Planning Service prior to commencing any work to trees or woodland.",
