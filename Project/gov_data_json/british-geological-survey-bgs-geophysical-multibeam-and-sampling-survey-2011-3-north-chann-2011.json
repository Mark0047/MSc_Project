        "notes": "This British Geological Survey (BGS) marine multibeam, geophysical and sampling survey took place in April/May 2013 onboard the RRS James Cook. Data was collected from the North-Western Approaches area, incorporating the Sea of the Hebrides, Malin Sea and North Channel region, and extending landwards into sea lochs, including Loch Linnhe and Loch Scavaig. Sea-bed samples were collected using 15m rock drill, vibrocorer and piston corer. Sub-bottom seismic profiling data were gathered using the SBP120 installed in the RRS James Cook. MSCL data was measured by the University of Leicester. Most of the acoustic data were recorded digitally, but paper records were generated also. In additional to the initial work plan, a multibeam bathymetry dataset was acquired from the Sound of Kilbrannan. All the samples are archived by BGS except six piston core working halves were taken by Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS) for further study. Technical details of the survey are contained in the BGS Report of Survey.",
