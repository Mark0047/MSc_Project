        "notes": "Wessex Archaeology (WA) was commissioned by English Heritage (EH) to undertake geophysical surveys as part of the project entitled \u2018Wrecks on the Seabed: Assessing, Evaluating and Recording\u2019, supported by Round 2 of the Aggregate Levy Sustainability Fund (ALSF). The specific aim of this project was to provide industry, regulators and contractors with guidance on the archaeological assessment, evaluation and recording of wreck sites. \u2018Assessment, evaluation and recording\u2019 are taken to include various methods of archaeological investigation that are intended to improve the understanding, preservation and appreciation of the historic environment. Geophysical surveys were conducted over five wreck site areas. This archive relates to the geophysical survey over the Liberator, an unknown wreck, and the submarine U86. Sidescan sonar and magnetometer data were acquired from the vessel Wessex Explorer on the 9th and 12th August 2005 and the multibeam echosounder data were acquired on the 15th and 19th August 2005. The geology and geophysics component of the data are archived at British Geological Survey (BGS) MEDIN Data Archive Centre (DAC) for Geology and Geophysics. Data were also provided to other archive centres as appropriate.",
