        "notes": "The data presented are quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) read outs from antimicrobial resistance gene (AMRG) assays and associated metadata from this project. In this dataset, the mean gene copy numbers per microlitre of DNA extract are shown. The data were collected from faecal and environmental samples which were obtained from a single British commercial pig unit. The former were collected from the sow housing barn, pig growing houses and slurry tanks within the farm unit and the latter were obtained through random stratified sampling of the farm and the surrounding land. These samples were taken from what will be referred to as the 'main study'. A further study was carried out to obtain samples after a partial depopulation which took place on this farm. Faecal samples were obtained from the sow housing barn, pig growing houses and slurry tanks and will be referred to as the 'depopulation (depop) study'. For the main study, the samples were collected between October 19th 2016 and April 5th 2017. For the depop study, the samples were collected between 19th June 2017 and 13th November 2017. The data associated with all samples were generated between August 1st 2017 and May 1st 2018.
