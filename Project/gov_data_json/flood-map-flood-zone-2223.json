New Flood Zones will be available when the new Flood Map for Planning is published at the end of Summer 2021.\r\nFlood Map shows the areas across Wales that could be affected by flooding from rivers or the sea. It also shows flood defences and the areas that benefit from them. Flood Map is designed to raise awareness among the public local authorities and other organisations of the likelihood of flooding and to encourage people living and working in areas prone to flooding to find out more and take appropriate action. The Flood Map includes several layers of information, this layer is: Flood Zone 2, which is NRWs best estimate of the areas of land between Zone 3 and the extent of the flood from rivers or the sea with a 1000 to 1 chance of flooding in any year. It includes those areas defined in Flood Zone 3.\r\n    ",
