        "notes": "This British Geological Survey (BGS) marine geophysical and sampling survey comprised several two week phases and took place from March to June 1974 in the Dogger, Forties and Forth Appoaches areas on board the MV Whitethorn. The main purpose was to obtain boreholes to prove the extent of the geology, standby work included 1) Sediment sampling 2) Shallow seismic profiling. Sea-bed samples and cores were collected using Gravity corer, Vibrocorer, shipek grab and Wireline drilling. Geophysical lines run included Pinger, sparker and echosounder equipment. Position fixing during the cruise was Main Chain Decca for standard sampling and geophysical lines and Decca RM 729 Alpine Radar Ranger for some boreholes. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS Technical Reports WB/MI/74/9 and WB/MI/74/14.",
