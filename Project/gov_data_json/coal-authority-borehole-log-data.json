Data coverage is UK wide and dates from the 1970's to the privatisation of the coal mining industry, in 1994. The dataset includes approximately 2000 field data recording tapes and processed data tapes. The processed data tapes are at various stages of processing and consist of edited data and computed (CSU) data (not available for all boreholes). The data are kept as archive copies. The data are owned by the Coal Authority (CA), as successor to the NCB and BCC, BGS being the custodian under an agreement with the Coal Authority. No full catalogue or index available yet.",
