        "notes": "This publication presents findings from the 2009 survey of home care service users, administered by Community Information Branch (CIB) of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS).  The Northern Ireland Audit Office\u2019s Older People and Domiciliary Care report (2007) highlighted the lack of information on the quality of domiciliary care in Northern Ireland.  The subsequent Public Accounts Committee recommended that the DHSSPS collect information on the quality of domiciliary care.  This survey was designed to focus on the service users' experiences of domiciliary care in relation to the level and quality of care they expect or need.  It was also used to investigate whether the service users questioned had been involved in the planning of their care and to examine whether they had received written information about their care plans from their provider.\n\nSource agency: Health, Social Service and Public Safety (Northern Ireland)\n\nDesignation: Official Statistics not designated as National Statistics\n\nLanguage: English\n\nAlternative title: Domiciliary Care Users in Northern Ireland",
