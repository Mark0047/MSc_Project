Some hauls were targeted at Greenland halibut *(*\n*Reinhardtius hippoglossoides*). The purpose of this report is to fulfil the \nGreenlandic Authorities\u2019 requirement to present observer-collected information \non cod (for details see below), so the results for Greenland halibut (and \nother species taken) are not presented.\n\nIn all, 116 tows targeting cod were carried out in two areas off the east \ncoast of Greenland, of which 46 where sampled for length and 40 of the 46 for \notoliths and other biological information. Discarded cod amounted to just \n0.08% of the total catch of the species (some of these fish were damaged on \nhauling and processing).",
