        "notes": "This marine sampling survey was carried out by George Wimpey & Co for British Geological Survey (BGS), the survey took place in August to September 1968 in the northeast Irish Sea on board the MV Moray Firth IV. This survey was carried out for a project in conjunction with geophysical survey 1968/3. The purpose was a general investigation of sea bottom sediments and the underlying rocks following on from surveys carried out in 1967. Sediment samples were collected using a shipek grab, gravity corer (rock and sediment) and vibracorer. Sea floor data were collected using Echo sounder. These data archived by BGS. Details of the survey are contained in BGS Technical report WB/MC/69/1.",
