        "notes": "The OSPAR (`https://www.ospar.org/convention`_) fish biodiversity assessment \nconcerns sensitive and often rare species in the northeast Atlantic Ocean and \nmarginal seas. All fish species captured during fishing on scientific \ngroundfish (otter and beam trawl) surveys are recorded but not necessarily \nweighed and measured for length. The biodiversity assessment for sensitive and \noften rare species thus makes use of the occurrences (presence and absences) \nof a species only.\n\nA list of sensitive fish species was developed to guide the work for the OSPAR \nfish biodiversity assessment. The list was created by first collating all \nsensitive fish species recorded on international and national hard law lists, \nRegional Seas Conventions lists, International Agreement Lists, relevant IUCN \nRed List species (classified as EX, CR, VU or EN) and all ICES and academic \nwork to identify sensitive fish species. From this extensive list of species, \nspecies were removed if they did not occur in the OSPAR area of the Northeast \nAtlantic Ocean. Remaining species were divided by region; Bay of Biscay and \nIberian Coast, Celtic Seas, Greater North Sea, Norwegian Sea and parts of \nMacaronesia where data was available. Those species whose normal distribution \nwas at the very edge of an OSPAR region were not assessed within the region.\n\n\n.. _`https://www.ospar.org/convention`:\n    https://www.ospar.org/convention",
