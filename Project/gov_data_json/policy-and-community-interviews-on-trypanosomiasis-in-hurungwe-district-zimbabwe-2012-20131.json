        "notes": "This resource contains anonymised interviews with community members in Chundu Ward, Hurungwe District, Zimbabwe, conducted to further our understanding of how the local community interacts with tsetse. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key informants in 2012 to 2013 to investigate livelihood strategies including hunting, livestock keeping and cultivation, and how they influenced the risk of contracting trypanosomiasis. Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) occurs sporadically within the Zambezi Valley in Zimbabwe and is transmitted by the tsetse fly (Glossina morsitans morsitans and Glossina pallidipes). African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) is more prevalent and places significant constraints on livestock keeping. Approaches taken by local people to control or manage the disease were also investigated during the interviews. This research was part of a wider research project, the Dynamic Drivers of Disease in Africa Consortium (DDDAC) and these interviews contributed to this consortium. The research was funded by NERC project no NE/J000701/1 with support from the Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation Programme (ESPA).
