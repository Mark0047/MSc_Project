        "notes": "This British Geological Survey (BGS) marine geophysical and multibeam survey took place in March 2005 in the area underneath and around the Forth bridges on board Fathoms Ltd's Multi Purpose Vessel Teal. The purpose was to obtain complete bathymetric coverage of the area between the Forth bridges, except where it was too shallow for safe operations. Multibeam bathymetry data were collected using a Reson Seabat 8125 run by Fathoms Ltd and the processed output supplied to BGS. Sub bottom seismic profiling data were gathered by BGS using a surface tow boomer. A magnetometer was also used. Most of the data were recorded digitally, but paper records were generated also. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the Multibeam survey are contained in Fathoms Report c104281 (nonBGS report 2007/3).",
