        "notes": "This layer of the map based index (GeoIndex) shows the locations of the Mineral Reconnaissance Programme Reports within Great Britain. The Mineral Reconnaissance Programme (MRP), funded by the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI), carried out mineral exploration reconnaissance in Great Britain between 1972 and 1997. The programme provided geological, geochemical, geophysical, mineralogical and metallogenic information on prospective areas in Britain. Work was carried out at various scales, from regional reconnaissance surveys or appraisal, to the drilling of a geochemical or geophysical anomaly. Projects were multidisciplinary, and used a combination of tried and tested methods, together with innovative techniques arising from research and development programmes. By the end of the Programme in 1997, 146 MRP reports had been issued covering localities across the UK. The programme was very successful in that more than half the projects reported attracted significant commercial follow-up resulting in the discovery of many new prospects. The reports themselves are being made available, for free, to downlaod over the next twelve months.",
