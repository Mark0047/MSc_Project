        "notes": "The Communal Heating Consumer Survey was conducted in October 2017 to collect feedback from consumers on their views on the quality and satisfaction of the communal heating scheme which provides space heating and hot water to their properties. A report has been published a year after, summarising the survey's key findings and results, and it can be downloaded [here](https://data.london.gov.uk/download/communal-heating-consumer-survey-report/13475a35-7cd4-4e54-af7d-60c9b35a1030/communal_heating_consumer_survey_final.pdf).\n\n  \n\nThe GLA is aware that residents in some new developments where CHP systems have been installed have expressed concerns about aspects of their heating arrangements. To better understand the issues, in October 2017 the GLA has undertaken a customer experience survey of residents of housing developments in London whose heating arrangements incorporate a communal heating system / on-site district heating network supplied by CHP. This has involved schemes installed both pre- and post-London Plan (2009). A total of 384 responses were gained from 44 sites across London.\n\n  \n\nThe survey conclusions have been contrasted with those of similar recent studies carried out by other organisations. The [BEIS Heat Network Consumer Survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/heat-networks-consumer-survey-consumer-experiences-on-heat-networks-and-other-heating-systems) (2017) and this survey both conclude that heat customers served by communal heating systems and heat networks, including CHP, are generally satisfied with their heating arrangements.",
