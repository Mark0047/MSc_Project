Many of those are listed in data.gov.uk datasets alongside the ones that have gone through the system (and a few are just on https://www.gov.uk/government/publications ). So this is not complete, but not far off.\r\n\r\nNB this dataset doesn't contain the actual organogram data - it is just a list of the releases and the URLs to get the data. This is helpful to understand how well government bodies are meeting their commitments.\r\nlisted at https://data.gov.uk/apps\r\n\r\nThis is exported from data.gov.uk's database. It is refreshed nightly.\r\n\r\nThe fields should be relatively self-explanatory when comparing the data with data.gov.uk organogram datasets: https://data.gov.uk/data/search?collection=Organogram",
