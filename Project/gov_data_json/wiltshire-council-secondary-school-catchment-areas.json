        "notes": "The secondary school catchment layer provides the schools catchment areas within Wiltshire. Please note that faith Schools eg. Catholic Schools do not have catchment areas and these are determined on faith grounds. \r\n\r\nThe Local Authority Schools; Community, Voluntary Aided & Foundation Schools were set historically by the Local Authority using parish/town boundaries and the Academies determine their own catchment areas. \r\n\r\nThese are updated annually when the schools confirm their Admissions policies. If there are any large developments that affect the town/parish boundaries this would also start the process for the catchment area to be updated.\r\n\r\nA WMS link to the data can be found at the bottom of the XML file.\r\nHowever, to ensure you're viewing the latest version, please visit our education web map, found here:\r\nhttps://wiltscouncil.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=78160d89e1004ccda210923b82ee9959",
