        "notes": "[THIS DATASET HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN]. This dataset includes a range of determinands present in soil water in the experimental plot at the Climoor field site in the Clocaenog Forest, in north-east Wales. Soil water was collected at two depths in the soil profile - approximately 5cm and 20cm. At the bottom of the rooting zone (approximately 5cm depth) zero tension lysimeters were used. At the deeper depth (approximately 20cm depth) ceramic cup suction samplers were used. Data were collected between October 1998 and March 2009 at two weekly intervals. Determinands include: pH, Ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), Nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), Sulphate (SO4-S), dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic nitrogen, Calcium (Ca), Potassium (K), Magnesium (Mg), Sodium (Na), Phosphate phosphorus (PO4-P), Chloride (Cl), total dissolved phophorus and total dissolved nitrogen. Full details about this dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5285/1deb9ee0-a01c-4ce6-a5b0-a1ad32beeff7",
