        "notes": "General soil chemical, physical and microbial properties are presented for soil samples at six depths collected from a field experiment in the Conwy catchment. Samples were collected in May 2015. Core samples were taken along three transects by trained members of staff the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology and Bangor University. General soil chemical, physical and microbial properties were measured at six depths by trained members of staff, using recognised procedures at the laboratories of the School of Environment, Natural Resources and Geography, Bangor University. The samples were taken to provide supporting information for assessing the relationship between soil microbial populations and soil properties. The data were collected for the NERC project 'The Multi-Scale Response of Water quality, Biodiversity and Carbon Sequestration to Coupled Macronutrient Cycling from Source to Sea' (NE/J011991/1). The project is also referred to as Turf2Surf. Full details about this dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5285/f7b2beaa-08cf-48db-9b07-c55118d11506",
