        "notes": "This BGS marine geochemical, geophysical and sampling survey took place in November/December 1978 in the Irish Sea area aboard the Royal Research Ship RRS John Murray. The purpose was to carry out a preliminary stage of an investigation of environmental radioactivity, IGS Applied Geochemistry Unit in conjunction with NUTMAQ group at Harwell. This provided an opportunity to gather data in an area with no previous coverage. A total of 2203 km of data were collected Sea floor data were collected using a echo-sounder and a transit sonar. Towed gamma spectrometer. Subsurface data were gathered using a suite of seismic instruments (airgun, sparker, pinger). Analogue data were collected and paper records were generated. Sea-bed samples and cores were collected using shipek grab and dredge. The data are archived by BGS.",
