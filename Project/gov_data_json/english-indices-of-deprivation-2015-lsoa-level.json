        "notes": "This dataset contains a range of measures which form the Indices of Deprivation 2015 at LSOA level. \n\nThe Indices of Deprivation 2015 provide a set of relative measures of deprivation for small areas (Lower-layer Super Output Areas*) across England, based on seven domains of deprivation. The domains were combined using the following weights to produce the overall Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD):\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIncome Deprivation (22.5%)\r\n\u2022\tEmployment Deprivation (22.5%)\r\n\u2022\tEducation, Skills and Training Deprivation (13.5%)\r\n\u2022\tHealth Deprivation and Disability (13.5%)\r\n\u2022\tCrime (9.3%)\r\n\u2022\tBarriers to Housing and Services (9.3%)\r\n\u2022\tLiving Environment Deprivation (9.3%)\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Index of Multiple Deprivation and the seven domain indices, there are two supplementary indices: the Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI) and the Income Deprivation Affecting Older People Index (IDAOPI). \r\n\r\n*LSOAs (Lower-layer Super Output Areas) are small areas designed to be of a similar population size, with an average of approximately 1,500 residents or 650 households. There are 32,844 Lower-layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) in England. They were produced by the Office for National Statistics for the reporting of small area statistics.\r\nFollowing the 2011 Census, the geography of Lower-layer Super Output Areas was revised and the number of areas has increased from 32,482 (as used for the Indices of Deprivation 2010, 2007 and 2004) to 32,844 (used for the Indices of Deprivation 2015). The boundaries of the vast majority (96 per cent) of these 32,844 areas are unchanged since the 2010, 2007 and 2004 Indices.\r\n\r\nA range of summary measures are available for higher-level geographies including local authority districts and upper-tier local authorities, local enterprise partnerships, and clinical commissioning groups. \r\n\r\nThe Index of Multiple Deprivation, domain indices and the supplementary indices, together with the higher-level geography summaries, are collectively referred to as the Indices of Deprivation.\r\n\r\nChapter 3 of the Research Report gives advice on using and interpreting the data.\r\n\r\nMost of the data used in the Indices of Deprivation 2015 relates to the tax year 2012/13\r\n - see Chapter 4 of the Technical Report for more details.\r\n\r\nAll of the data files and supporting documents for the English Indices of Deprivation 2015 are available at http://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2015 .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor statistical enquiries, please contact: mailto:indices.deprivation@communities.gsi.gov.uk   \r\n",
