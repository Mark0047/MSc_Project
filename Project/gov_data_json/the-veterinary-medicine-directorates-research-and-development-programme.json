Peer Review reports and interim project reports are not published because (a) results in an interim report may not be confirmed in the final report and (b) we positively encourage publiction of scientific papers arising from studies we support and we know  from experience that peer review journals will refuse to accept papers for publication if the results of have been previously published (e.g. on the Defra website). Publishing commercially sensitive  project proposals or interim reports would potentially seriously jeopardise our R&D programme and leave us open to publishing results openly which we do not  have the support of peer review to give them credibility and would therefore not be  an appropriate basis on which to justify any  policy making decisions."
