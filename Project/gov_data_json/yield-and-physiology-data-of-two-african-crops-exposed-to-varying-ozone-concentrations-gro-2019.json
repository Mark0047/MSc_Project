        "notes": "Data are presented from an ozone exposure experiment performed on two African crops. The crops (beans and sweet potato) were exposed to three different levels of ozone in the heated UK CEH Bangor solardomes. The experiment ran from June 2019 to October 2019. The crop plants were grown from seed (beans) or plug plants (sweet potato), in pots in solardomes. The aim of the experiment was to investigate the impact of ozone exposure on the crop yield and plant health. The dataset comprises of manually collected data on plant physiology, biomass and yield. In addition the automatically logged data of ozone concentration and meteorological variables in the solardomes are presented. Plant physiology data is stomatal conductance of individual leaves, measured on an ad-hoc basis. The dataset includes the associated data measured by the equipment (relative humidity, leaf temperature, photosynthetically active radiation). Soil moisture of the pots was always measured at the same time, and chlorophyll content of the measured leaf was usually, but not always, determined at the same time. Yield of beans and sweet potato was determined for each plant. The ozone and meteorological dataset is complete, but with some gap-filling for short periods when the computer was not logging data. The work was carried out as part of the NERC funded SUNRISE project (NE/R000131/1). Full details about this dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5285/48456cbf-4873-4a2b-9625-ad22a207c462",
