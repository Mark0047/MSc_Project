Facilities covered by this legislation are known as Installations and generally have significant releases to air land or water or carry out certain larger scale waste management activities.  Further information on the Environmental Permitting Regulations (EPR) and the IPPC directive is available on our website or at www.defra.gov.uk \nThis dataset covers all Process Industry sites within the EPR regime and some larger waste activities. Other smaller waste facilities are known as 'Waste Operations' (formerly known as Waste Management Licences) and are covered in a separate dataset see below.
