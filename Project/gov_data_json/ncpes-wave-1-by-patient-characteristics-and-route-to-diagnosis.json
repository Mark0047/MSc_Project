        "notes": "The English Cancer Patient Experience Survey (CPES) is commissioned by NHS England and administered on their behalf by an external survey provider organisation (Quality Health).  The survey provides insights into the care experienced by cancer patients across England who were treated as day cases or inpatients.

Individual responses to Wave 1 of CPES are recorded , alongside characteristics of the patient who has completed the survey.\r\n\r\nWave 1 of the National Cancer Patient Experience Survey is limited to patients discharged from cancer care between 01/01/2010 \u2013 31/03/2010.\r\n\r\nData within the file:\r\n--PATIENT_PSEUDO_ID (Project specific Pseudonymised Patient ID)\r\nGENDER (coded Male, Female)\r\n--QUINTILE2010 (Deprivation quintile [1-5], describing the  Income Deprivation Domain where 1= least deprived and 5= most deprived)\r\n--FINAL_ROUTE (One of eight Routes to Diagnosis-  methodology for the assignment of  each route is described  in Elliss-Brookes L, McPhail S, Greenslade M, Shelton J, Hiom S, Richards M (2012) Routes to diagnosis for cancer \u2013 determining the patient journey using multiple routine data sets.
