        "notes": "These surveys were carried out to describe the habitats, communities and species on littoral rock throughout the archipelago and to classify the sites described according to their scientific interest and probable nature conservation importance. Sites were selected from maps and charts to ensure that as wide a range of habitats as possible was surveyed in the time available. Systematic surveys were carried out of open-shore communities and records of the abundance of conspicuous species were obtained from the main subzones on the shore. These results enable the classification of different shore types based on communities present and topographical features. Particular attention was given to the description of other habitats such as rockpools, boulders and caves. Colour transparency photographs were taken of the shores and habitats present and of species. Algae were collected and pressed to provide a reference herbarium of Isles of Scilly algae. In order to map the distribution of different shore types, survey results, observations of shores made whilst travelling between sites, aerial photographs and photographs held by NCC were used. 46 sites were described during the two periods of survey and a total of 128 algal, 13 lichen and 237 animal taxa were recorded. 9 different shore types were described ranging from those exposed to very severe wave action at Bishop Rock and the Western Rocks, to those very sheltered from wave action in the channels between islands, and from the bedrock shores of the seaward-facing coasts to the boulders and boulders on sand of the enclosed coasts. Seperate descriptions were made of the communities present under boulders, in boulder caves and in rockpools. The rocky shore communities present in the Isles of Scilly were distinctly southern in character, but the fauna of open shores was somewhat impoverished when compared with mainland shores, probably as a result of the isolation of the islands. In the assessment of the nature conservation importance of shores, special features of shores in the Isles of Scilly were considered to be: the high diversity of habitats and therefore of communities and species along the coastline; the presence of many southern species; the high scientific interest of adjacent terrestrial areas; the potential for development of interpretative facilities; the high intrinsic (scenic) appeal of the coast. Particularly high importance was given to the presence of exceptionally exposed shores and the presence of sheltered shores amongst the islands which include very rich underboulder communities. Recommendations for future work included: - that rapid surveys by boat and/or foot should be made to provide accurate maps of the location and extent of different shore types and to ensure that all of the main habitats and communities have been included in the assessment of the shores; - that a collation of available information on the shores of the Isles of Scilly is undertaken; - that biologists with experience of Isles of Scilly shores should be asked to assess the scientific interest and conservation value of shores with which they are familiar and that a search of the literature should be carried out to ensure the listing of all species of high scientific interest; - that the categories included in the NCC rocky shore recording sheet should be thoroughly reviewed and a new sheet developed.",
