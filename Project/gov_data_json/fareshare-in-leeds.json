This figure includes food to the Leeds Warehouse and food to third sector organisations such as food banks, soup kitchens, and charities.\n\nFrom 15/07/20 the data was changed to being recorded on a fortnightly instead of weekly basis.\n\nNB The large Leeds Warehouse was wound down from 1st Sept, after which point a smaller warehouse was set up to make up food parcels as part of the post lockdown emergency support service. From this date the report shows food being delivered to third sector organisations and is reported on an adhoc basis.",
