        "notes": "This dataset provides a detailed physical science dataset to the groundwater resource and engineering properties of 150 handpumped borehole supplies (HPBs) across Ethiopia, Malawi and Uganda, surveyed in 2017. The dataset includes measurements of aquifer resource potential, groundwater quality, downhole construction and condition of handpump components, and borehole construction. Detailed social science data were also collected as part of the second survey phases of the Hidden Crisis project. However, these data are reported as a separate (associated) dataset to the physical science Survey 2 dataset \u2013 and are available from Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) UK Data Service (UKDS). The Hidden Crisis project (2015-20) was an international research project aimed at developing a robust evidence base and understanding of the complex and multi-faceted causes which underlie the current high failure rates of many new groundwater supplies in Africa. The project was jointly funded by: DFID, NERC and ESRC as part of the UPGro programme. The project carried out the research work in three countries - Ethiopia, Malawi and Uganda \u2013 to examine functionality and performance of groundwater supplies in a range of hydrogeological, climatic and social, institutional and governance environments in East Africa. The work focused specifically on examining the functionality of HPBs \u2013 these being the main form of improved community water supply across rural Africa. The Survey 2 dataset, is major dataset developed by the project.",
