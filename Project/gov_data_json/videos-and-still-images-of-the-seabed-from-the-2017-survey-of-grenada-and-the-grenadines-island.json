        "notes": "As part of the Commonwealth Marine Economies Programme (CMEP) Cefas collected \n87 drop camera video tows of the seabed on the southern and western sides of \nthe island of Grenada and around the Carriacou and the Grenadines Islands. \nThese videos of the seabed were to characterise the benthic fauna within the \narea and support the creation of benthic habitat maps from UKHO lidar data. \nThe videos and still images were acquired during the 2017 survey using a \nlightweight drop camera frame with two GoPros simultaneously collecting stills \nand video data. Two lasers were fitted for scaling images and additional \nlighting provided real colour images of the seabed. The drop camera frame was \nlowered to the seabed by hand from a vessel, with the video monitored to \nmaintain a consistent height above the seabed. Tows were 15 minutes long with \nthe vessel drifting in neutral so the distance covered in each tow varied. \nSample depths ranged from 3-40 m and covered a range of habitats including \nbare sediment, seagrass, and coral and sponge dominated reefs. Still images \nwere acquired every minute at a point when the seabed was clearly in focus.",
