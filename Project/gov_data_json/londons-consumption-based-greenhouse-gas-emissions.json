        "notes": "Tackling London\u2019s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is a huge challenge. The impact of these emissions goes far beyond the city\u2019s boundaries. From the electronics we buy and the food we eat to the clothes we wear, most are produced and transported globally.\n\nThe Mayor, together with London Councils and ReLondon, has jointly commissioned Leeds University to develop a historic trend of consumption-based emissions for London. It uses the latest available data (running from 2001-2021) on average expenditure on different types of goods and services. This methodology aligns with equivalent national government datasets at the UK level.\n\n**Findings**\n\nLondon\u2019s consumption-based emissions in 2021 were around 80 MtCO 2 e. They\u2019ve fallen by 24 per cent since 2001, despite the city\u2019s population increasing by 1.4 million over that time. This means emissions per head have reduced by 35 per cent (from 13.9 to 8.98 tCO 2 e per person).\n\n\u00a0The biggest drop in consumption-based emissions was between 2008 and 2009 during the global financial crisis, when households\u2019 average spending decreased. Post 2009, emissions stabilised then steadily reduced from 2014 to 2020, bar a small increase from 2017-2018. This period of emissions reduction has been mainly driven by decarbonisation of the UK electricity sector.\n\n**The national context**\n\nLondon\u2019s per capita consumption-based footprint is slightly lower than the UK average. It also follows a similar trend in reduction over the same period. However, at a sector level there are some cases where the per capita emissions for Londoners are different, for example:\n\n*   **Transport**\u00a0\u2013\u00a0London\u2019s use of transport is unlike any other region in the UK. Private transport emissions are much lower than any other region, and public transport emissions are the highest in the country. As a result, London has the lowest per capita transport emissions of any region and is lower than the UK average. However, London also has one of the highest per capita aviation emissions. Transport emissions were still unusually low in 2021 due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n*   **Housing, water, electricity, gas, other fuels**\u00a0\u2013 Compared to other regions in the UK, Londoners spend less on heating and power. This is a function of increased household occupancy rather than lower energy bills and more efficient homes.\n*   **Food and drink**\u00a0\u2013 Compared to other regions in the UK, Londoners spend less on meat, which contributes to a lower food footprint per capita.\n\n**The international context**\n\nThe Mayor wants to recognise the full environmental impact of London\u2019s consumption by publishing this data. We hope this will encourage more cities to publish their consumption-based emissions data so we can identify similarities and work together to bring these emissions down.",
