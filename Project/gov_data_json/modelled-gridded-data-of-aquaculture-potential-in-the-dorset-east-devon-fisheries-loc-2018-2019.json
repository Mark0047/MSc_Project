The purpose of the project was to \nidentify and map areas best suited (and with least conflict) to specific types \nof sustainable marine aquaculture, within the boundaries of the Dorset and \nEast Devon Fisheries Local Action Group (FLAG) area. The aquaculture potential \nlayers were derived by combining information on conservation and legislative \nboundaries, human infrastructure and activity constraints, with environmental \nrequirements for various combinations of aquaculture species and growing \nsystem, to identify areas of potential for each species/system combination.\n\nThe filenames of layers representing unique species/system combinations are in \nthe format:\n\n\u2018Dorset-EDevon-FLAG_[**species_name**]_[**growing_system**\n]_AquaPotential.tif\u2019\n\nThe filenames of layers representing grouped species/systems are in the \nformat:\n\n\u2018Dorset-EDevon-FLAG_[**species_group**]_ALL_AquaPotential.tif\u2019\n\nThe data layers represent a broad overview of aquaculture potential in the \nDorset and East Devon FLAG area, but detailed site-specific investigations \nwould be required for local planning applications and licensing purposes.",
