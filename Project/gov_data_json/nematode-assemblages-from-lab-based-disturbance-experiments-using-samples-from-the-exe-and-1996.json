Bulk sediment samples were collected \nfrom both the Exe estuary and the Lynher estuary between February and May \n1996. This data is the result of labatory experiments on physical disurbance \nand details the counts of different nematode species of samples following \ndisturbance and various lengths of recovery time. The Read Me file contains \nfurther information on the experiments conducted on each microcosm.",
