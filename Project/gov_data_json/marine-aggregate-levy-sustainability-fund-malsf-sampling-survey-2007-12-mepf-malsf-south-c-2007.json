        "notes": "This Gardline marine geophysical and sampling survey took place during July/September 2007 along the south coast of England around the Isle of Wight aboard the MV Ocean Seeker. This survey was undertaken for the South Coast Regional Environmental Characterisation (REC). This study was funded by the Marine Environment Protection Fund (MEPF) a marine component of the Aggregate Levy Sustainability Fund (MALSF). The study was conducted in two parts, with this survey covering the groundtruthing data. Seabed samples were obtained using a clamshell grab, hamon grab and photo and video data exist for these sites. Most of the data were recorded digitally. These data are archived with the MEDIN Data Archive Centres (DACs), including the BGS DAC for geology and geophysics. Technical details of the survey are contained in Gardline Report 7261",
