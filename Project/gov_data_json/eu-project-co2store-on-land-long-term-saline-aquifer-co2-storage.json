        "notes": "EU is required to reduce its CO2 emissions by 8% by 2008-2012, later deeper cuts are foreseen. CO2 underground storage is one of the few options that can meet these obligations. The present project investigates four new potential cases for CO2-reservoirs, mainly on land. It will continue reservoir simulations and study geochemical reactions to develop final-fate prediction models. This will be supported by new seismic observations. At the same time gravimetrics is introduced as a new method better suited on land. This proposal builds directly on the Thermie/5FP SACS2 project results, which involved monitoring and modelling the injection of CO2 into the Utsira Sand aquifer, at Sleipner gas field, offshore Norway.",
