However, there are \ncurrently, very few long-term datasets within the European context available \nfor parameterising such models.\n\nDAPSTOM (Integrated Database and Portal for Fish Stomach Records) is an \nongoing initiative (supported by Defra and the EU) to digitize and make \navailable fish stomach content records spanning the past 100 years. The online \ndatabase contains information (over 225,000 records) on 188 predator species \n(most of those occurring in northern European groundfish surveys) and can be \nsearched by predator name or by prey name for given sea areas and years. CSV \ndata files can be outputted containing all records from a particular query. \nThe current database contains information spanning 1893 - 2012.",
