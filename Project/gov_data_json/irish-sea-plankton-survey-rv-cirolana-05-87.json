In \n1987 sampling was confined to the western Irish Sea. Ichthyoplankton samples \nwere collected at each site on a planned survey grid. The data described here \nconsists of the numbers of fish eggs and larvae (also *Nephrops* larvae) \nidentified from the main net samples collected on the survey in May 1987, \nalong with associated positional and ancillary data and volumes filtered.",
